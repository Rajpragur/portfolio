1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details
I made a little funko pop e-store using a server. Here's a link to my essay's https://ttruong4.github.io/essays/

2. What did you learn from this assignment?
I learned that this assignment is very difficult in terms of getting things to work as opposed to assignment 1. I was able to copy code and get things to work for assignment 1 but for assignemnt 2, I was struggling a lot because I had to understand the what each line of code was actually doing and Professor Port helped me understand the fundamental concepts through his office hours. 

3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
No, I wasn't able to find a partner to work with on this assignment.  

4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
It was a little tough getting a hold of Daniel on a 1-1 session since other students were also getting help but I kept emailing Daniel and was able to show up to his office hours. I had a hard time figuring out routing and getting my assignment to work. I understood the concept of what I was supposed to do it's just putting the code in and making it perform what I would like was the biggest challenge for me. 

5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
I feel like in assignment 1, it was more creating html pages and modifying where copying code and pasting it would work but for assignment 2, you have to understand what each line of code does because most of the problems that I had were in the server.js. 

6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
For me I would say I spent 60% thinking about how to do soemthing, 15% writing code and 25% testing and debugging. These percentages came out this way because I was mainly thinking on how to do something, I write the code, I test it and when it fails, I go back to the thinking stage. 

7. Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?
The thing that worked well with this project is that I was able create something that could potentially be used in the future. The things that didn't work well was getting the project to work the way it was supposed to.

8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?
I would have started on the this assignment a lot sooner because I didn't think it would've taken up this much time to complete the assignment.
