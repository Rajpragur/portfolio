## Programming Languages (C/C++/Java)

  Being introduced to a new programming language is always exciting. Learning new syntax and ways that programming languages can be appropriate for different problems. The many different ways on how variables get passed through functions and new ways of controlling and creating objects is always thrilling to me. Throughout my semesters as a Computer Science major, I have experienced C/C++ and Java and learned that they are two very different programming languages. They can both accomplish the same tasks, but certain tasks are easier for a given programming languages. Java I found it to be a great introduction to getting into Computer Science. In my two semesters I spent learning java, we used a program called jGrasp. In this program, it was easy for programmers to easily compile and run their code. If any errors seem to come up, there would be an error checker that will tell you exactly where you went wrong. On the other hand, C++ i found it difficult to compile and run code using terminal. If any errors would occur, it wouldn't exactly be code-friendly to pinpoint where your code went wrong. However, I found C/C++ to be fun in a way. Navigating through folders and programs through a terminal made me feel like a real programmer. I also found C/C++ to be able to be more in control of your computer device, like driving a manual transmission car. All programing languages have their uses with their pros and cons. However, to me, it does not seem right to classify them as good as bad as they all have a learning curve associated with them.

### Coding in Javascript
  
  This semester spring of 2019, I take a dive into JavaScript. Having no prior knowledge or experience working with JavaScript, the modules, WODS, I have worked on so far, coding in JavaScript is very user-friendly. Being able to start writing code without any main method makes it very fast to use. For example, Java would need "public static void main(string[] args){}" for every program made. C++ would have a similar main method. In JavaScript, I like that you can write functions right from the get-go which makes the in-class WOD's very fun. Although it does not matter how fast you complete the WOD's if you finish it. I also like to enjoy some personal competition to see who can finish writing codes the fastest. Also, this style allows me to read the WOD for the day, and really think about the functions, loops, if/else statements I’m about to write in my program. However, this can be very stressful finishing an algorithm within a certain amount of time, I know this type of stress will help me in the real world where in companies, Developers and Computer Scientists will not have all the time in the world to complete a project. There might be times where I’d must fix bugs on the get-go on certain company websites, or security breaches. Having to work all throughout my high school and college years, I find it useful to continually put ourselves into these stressful situations in order work efficiently and get the job done.
  
You can learn JavaScript too on [JavaScript API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction)
