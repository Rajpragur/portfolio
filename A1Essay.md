My programming skills have improved since the last few assignments. For example, I am a lot more patient when it comes to debugging. I can take the time to sit and really figure out where I went wrong in my code. At the beginning, that was very hard for me. However, I still have a long way to go. I need to work on my foundations to improve my programming skills. I think that I am still missing a few foundational concepts that affect my code as I'm advancing. I also struggle to follow along in class when we are doing labs. I still have to go back and rewatch lectures fairly often because I miss things the first time. I really feel as though I learn the most from the WODs, however. Trying on my own, seeing an example, trying again and then explaining it in the recording is definitely the most effective learning method for me. I think the class could be improved by having more TAâ€™s and more involvement with TAs. I really learn well when I don't feel rushed and I can work one on one with someone on a problem I am having.
