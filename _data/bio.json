I am pursuing B.A. in Computer Science with a minor in Psychology and plan to graduate in May 2019. This summer, I worked at AccesSurf Hawai'i, a non-profit that helps people with disabilities experience the healing power of the ocean through water-based activities. I hope to someday combine my passions for technology, community and social good.",
