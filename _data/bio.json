    "summary": "I am a B.Tech student in Mathematics and Computing at the Department of Mathematics, IIT Patna, with an expected graduation in Spring 2028. \n\tWith a strong foundation in mathematics and algorithmic problem-solving alongwith strong grasp of core computer science concepts, including Operating Systems, Database Management Systems (DBMS), and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), I am particularly interested in quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, competitive programming, and machine learningâ€”especially in natural language processing (NLP). \nMy experience includes research consultancy at WorldQuant, where I develop quantitative trading strategies, and leading fAInance.pro and Trippr (self projects). I have a solid background in competitive programming. \n\tAcademically, I have excelled in mathematical competitions such as IOQM (Top 0.8%) and AIME, alongside achieving a 99.7 percentile in JEE Mains. My technical skills include Python, C++, Machine Learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn), and financial modeling including.\n\tI am always eager to expand my knowledge and explore deeper into research, particularly in machine learning. I find the field fascinating and constantly seek opportunities to understand its intricacies, contribute meaningfully, and push my own boundaries in solving complex real-world problems.",
