summary: Worked on implementing a 16-bit Single-Cycle LEGv8 Processor in SystemVerilog, while learning about computer architecture and circuit design.

This lab was an implementation of a simplified five-stage pipeline processor. It went over the implementation of CPU instructions and handling data and control hazards in the pipeline. After finishing the lab, we were able to gain a better understanding of how the pipeline works by implementing the instructions and writing code to deal with the possible hazards that can occur in the pipeline by using NOPs both in the program and in the CPU.
