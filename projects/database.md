summary: The implementation of a database program written from scratch in the C language.
---

A functionable Database written in the C language This database uses a Singly Linked List of structs, uses command line arguments and a global variable to enable debug mode, and reads and writes structs to files for saving and loading information.  I have also included the Makefile used to compile and produce the executable.
