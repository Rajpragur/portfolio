Real life motion such as heart beats and breathing can be constructed through robotic implementations. Genuine humanoid movement 
is what we seek when testing motion sensing. Dynamic movement such as alternating breathing patterns is the essential base for our 
system. The breathing motion system is designed using linear actuators and a connected arduino to control the robotic movement.

This central goal was further broken down into several major sub-goals: 1) To create a portable and testable chest model that could 
be programmed to simulate different patterns. 2) To create a program that produces precise patterns that replicate human breathing 
patterns. 3) To use doppler radar sensors to acquire data and develop algorithms to determine what breathing patterns we see.
