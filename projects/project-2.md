Android App Development is a project that teaches the students how to build their own app. We develop our own individual app, with the purpose of learning how to code and how to be creative with our ideas. 

We begin by learning the skills needed to build a basic app. Practice labs and miscellaneous projects are made to understand the process of building an app. Then we brainstorm and research ideas that to help create our own original app. 

In this project, I gain a lot of experience in working in a team, coding, and design. I learn the necessary tools that app developers use in their line of  work.
