Bank Database Simulator is a program I created for ICS 212. This was the first major project I worked on in the language c. The point of the program is to simulate and application that a bank would use for storing account information of their customers. This program includes an User Interface which allows users to access different functions. Users may add an account, delete an account, get data from an account, get data from all accounts, and exit the program. In this program I used a linked list to be able to iterate through each account. 

This program taught me how important it is to trace code, especially when working in c. There were many bugs involving pointers that I had solved by tracing my program. By doing this project, I was able to get a deeper understanding of pointers and other features of c. I also learned a lot about computers, such as how they store information in memory. 

You can see the code in my repository [Koby Villalobos's GitHub](https://github.com/koby-villalobos/account-simulator).
