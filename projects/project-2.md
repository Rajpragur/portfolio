summary: An animation created for ICS 111.
---

This animation was developed as the second project in ICS 111, using java. This was an individual project.

This project required us to use java to create "scripts" for characters and animate a small scene of our choosing. Using several characters, I made a story between a couple post break-up.

This was to demonstrate our understanding and capability of having more than one class that used different programs and our understanding of rotation.
