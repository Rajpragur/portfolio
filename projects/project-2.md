This site was the final assignment for ICS 101 (Tools for the Info World) class.  The assignment was to ensure we understood basic concepts of how HTML and CSS works, and that we could create a website to be view online.  

The site is created with Dreamweaver, a development tool for creating, publishing and managing websites.
