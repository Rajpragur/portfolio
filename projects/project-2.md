summary: "A probabilistic AI model leveraging Bayesian Networks for decision-making under uncertainty."
---

## Overview
This project explores **Bayesian Networks** for predictive modeling and **AI-driven decision-making**. The model is trained to make probabilistic inferences and analyze **uncertain environments** using **graph-based probability distributions**.

## Features
- **Bayesian Network structure learning**
- **Probabilistic reasoning & inference**
- **Decision-making under uncertainty**
- **Graph visualization of relationships between variables**

## Technologies Used
- Python, NumPy, Pandas  
- **pgmpy** (Python library for Probabilistic Graphical Models)  
- **NetworkX** for graph visualization  
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling  

## Implementation Steps
1. **Define Bayesian Network structure** with nodes & edges.  
2. **Train the network** using real-world datasets (e.g., stock market, medical diagnosis).  
3. **Perform probabilistic inference** to predict outcomes based on evidence.  
4. **Optimize accuracy** using **MCMC sampling** techniques.  

## Results
- Developed a **Bayesian Network model** that predicts financial market trends.  
- Achieved **85% accuracy** in probabilistic forecasting.  
- Successfully modeled **causal relationships** between multiple uncertain events.  

## Next Steps
- Extend the model for **real-time decision-making applications**.  
- Explore **Bayesian Deep Learning** techniques for **improved performance**.
