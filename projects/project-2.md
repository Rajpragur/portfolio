summary: The big project for ICS 212 was to create a Bank Database that utilized a linked list to store different records, containing an Address, Account Number and Name
---

For this project, we were required to create a Bank database using the linked list data structure.  The database was required to have a friendly user interface, as well as the ability to hold different bank records that contain a name, address, and account number.

The first version of this project was written in C code, and was very difficult to write.  The amount of code needed to make certain aspects of the program to work was difficult and tedious.  The second version was written in C++ code and I felt much more comfortable writing it as C++ is a much more forgiving language.  I was able to create a fully functioning version of the program with no bugs or problems that would prevent the program from running, or preforming the duties required.

This project really helped to strengthen my coding skills to a point at which I feel more comfortable, and less stressed.  Learning C and C++ in this class was difficult, but in my opinion it was worth it.  My professor said that this class was the a "make it or break it" class, meaning that this class would either give people the drive to finish or computer science or this class would finish their computer science career.  I definitly feel that this class gave me even more drive to finish, as the challenges presented in this class made me hungry for more.
