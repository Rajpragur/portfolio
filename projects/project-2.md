This project implements a **Bayesian Network** for predictive modeling and AI-driven decision-making. It uses **pgmpy** for probabilistic graphical modeling.

### Features:
âœ” **Bayesian Network for probabilistic reasoning.**  
âœ” **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for uncertainty modeling.**  
âœ” **Application in stock price prediction & decision analysis.**
