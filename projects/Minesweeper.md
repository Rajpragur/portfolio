Minesweeper is a game in where you are given a gameboard with unmarked tiles where you need to clear tiles by clicking on them and flagging certain tiles that you may think are bombs (the amount of tiles and bombs depend on the difficulty).  If you click on a bomb you lose.  In order to win you must flag all bombs and clear all tiles which are not bombs.  An in game feature that we have also implemented is that whenever you click on a clear square it opens up other clear tiles that it is touching and continues to do so until it comes into contact with tiles that are closer to bombs.  We also added an additional feature to our game in form of a high score board that holds the top 10 scores from each difficulty.
