summary: A series of fiction stories

During my years in high school, I spent a lot of my free time writing stories. I remember when I was younger, I would read a lot and in middle school, I would fiddle around with short stories that I never really published. However, when I reached high school, my friend encouraged me to post my own stories on this website called Wattpad, which is a website with a collection of stories written by people around the world. Since then, I posted several stories, which are both good and bad. However, I feel that I like writing on this website because I'm able to receive feedback on my stories to help me become a better writer.
