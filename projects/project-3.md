summary: A method for secure RF communication

<img class="ui image" src="../images/iJam.png">

In wireless communications, being able to privately communicate between two points is important. There are various methods for RF communications that attempt to prevent an eavesdropper from decrypting the message. The method that my group came with is iJam with channel randomization, where it utilizes both methods of friendly jamming, and channel randomization to prevent an eavesdropping from decrypting what is sent. So far we were able to get some preliminary results and present our findings in WiSec 2020. We hope to further our research and test this method in various scenarios to determine its viability.
