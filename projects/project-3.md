summary: program the stores data for pokemon.
---

This is a program that I created for ICS 212.

This is the first one of the first experiences I had with the programming language c++. The program stores data for pokemon using a vector and a map, and prints it out. I learned a lot about c++ when creating this program, which is why I chose to include it.


You can see the code in my repository [Koby Villalobos's GitHub](https://github.com/koby-villalobos/pokemon).
