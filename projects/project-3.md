summary: My experience learning and playing piano.

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/music.png">

I began playing and learning piano seriously at age 20. This may seem late by some, but I feel I have picked up the instrument fairly easily. I had some experience with music prior, playing saxophone in high-school band and dabbling with guitar, however I feel my strongest instrument most suited to me is the piano.

So far I have enjoyed the journey. I started slow, playing basic songs. However now I can play experts from challenging classical pieces, as well as some "fun" songs like Toy Story and the like. Reading and learning sheet music has similarity to Computer Science. Reading sheet is a lot like reading code; there are many little pieces that when pulled together creates a beautiful, cohesive project. I also have experienced recording some of my songs, and have uploaded them to my iTunes account so that I can listen to and study my playing.

You open your eyes, and you are greeted by an unfamiliar ceiling.
Startled, you get to your feet and quickly scan your surroundings. It's
dark except for the stream of light coming from a crack on the only boarded
window in the room. You try to peek through the crack, but you cannot see
anything. You wonder where you are and who could have possibly brought you here.

look
The room is a picture of decay with only a faded number identifying it as room-4. The bed you were
 lying on is stained with what looks like dried blood. Could it be your blood? No - it is not. The
 only way out of the room aside from the door to the corridor is a window that is boarded shut. It
 looks like it has been like that for decades. There is a door going west from here. You see a candle
 on the floor. You see a match on the floor.

The candle is now lit. It illuminates everything in the room.

walk west
The corridor is lit with the candle. It is so long that you cannot see to the end. You notice that
 there are words written on the wall. There is a door going east from here. There is a way going north
 from here. There is a door going south from here.
