summary: I am a teaching assistant for a lab section of the course Japanese Americans.
---

The course, Japanese Americans taught by Dennis Ogawa, talks about Japanese Americans and their contributions in changing history. It introduces the start of Japanese American history. The course mostly focuses on different generations of Japanese Americans from Hawaii and their experiences. History about Japanese Internment camps and Japanese American involvement in World War II was taught as well.

As a TA, I am responsible for all the students in my section. My responsibilities include grading all student assignments, quizzes, and exams. My goal is to help students understand more about the topic of Japanese Americans in Hawaii because they are a big part of significant events that occured in Hawaii. To achieve this goal, I review important topics covered in lectures and assist students when needed.

From my experience, I developed time management skills when developing a schedule for the students. I also acquired leadership skills from advising students on mistakes or improvements in their work. My speaking and presentation skills have also improved.
