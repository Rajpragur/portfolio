summary: A game created for ICS 111.
---

This game was developed as the final project in ICS 111, using java. This was a group project, coded only by myself and my teammate, a total of two people.

For this project, we were required to recreate any game of our choosing. We chose to recreate pacman. Using the WASD keys, were to control pacman to collect all the pellets and avoid the ghosts that roamed the maze. 

This was to demonstrate our ability to work in partnerships and what we had learned over the semester.
