summary: I created a hexadecimal sudoku puzzle solver in my ICS 211 class.
---

For this project, I created a java program that recursively solves a hexdecimal sudoku puzzle. The sudoku puzzle must be 16x16 in size. The program will fill all empty spots in the sudoku puzzle. The program will output the puzzle and its solution into the console of the IDE. This project was one of my homework assignments for my ICS 211 class, and in my opinion the most difficult.
