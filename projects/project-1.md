Mario Flight Simulator is a group project created by by Angeli Amascual, Alton Lee, and Koby Villalobos. We made a game that was mario themed, and was inspired by flappy bird. You control mario(or luigi) and fly past bullet bills while colleting coins to increase your score. You are given a certain amount of health, but may recover some health by collecting mushroooms. The longer the game runs, the faster the bullet bills fly by! Your score will be recorded, so challange yourself to beat the high-scores.

For this project, I worked on four classes. These classes are "Health.java", "Block.java", "GameSet.java", and "MainFunc.java". For "Health.java", I created a health system, where when hit by bullet bills your health would decrease until reaching zero, where the game would end. You may also increase your health when collecting mushrooms. In the "Block.java: class, I made the bullet bills who fly past the screen, and reset their position to go back into the screen in an infinite loop. "GameSet.java" is a class that configures the different elements of the game, such as the Background, music, etc. Lastly "MainFunc.java" is a class that includes the main function, which combinds all the other classes in the project.
