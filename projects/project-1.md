Graphene is a thin layer of pure carbon; it is a single, tightly packed layer of carbon atoms that are bonded together in a hexagonal honeycomb lattice. Graphene has many extraordinary properties. It is about 100 times stronger than the strongest steel. It conducts heat and electricity efficiently and is nearly transparent.

For my project, I was responsible for experimentation. I started by researching the properties of light in an underwater situation.  My partner and I created the simulation with an adjusted laser and fishtank. We recorded the intensity of the waves being captured by the graphene detector. Our results did not lead to anything substanitial but it was an intuitive experience.
