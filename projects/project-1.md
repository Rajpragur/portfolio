This was one of my first projects that introduced me to ICS and resulted in my decision to enter the Computer Science field. The obstacle course game is very simple. In the project, the goal of the game is to go around collecting objects that are moving around, while avoiding stationary objects. When all the objects are collected the game stops and a victory sign is shown and victory music plays. If the player crashes into a stationary object, the game is stopped and a failure sign is shown. The game resets when the player fails. 

The introductory class used an Java Graphics Library created by Kobayashi Dylan to make it easier for students to visualize and learn Java.
