Rebound Rumble was the competition in 2012 held by FIRST that allowed teams of students and teachers to compete in a robotic game. Each team was given 2 months to create a robot to participate in the competition. The robot had to shoot a foam basketball into the hoops on a 27' x 54 court. In the middle of the court there is a barier and the only way to cross it is through the tilting bridge. Each team can assign three people to drive their robot during the game, 2 drivers and 1 coach. You can learn about the game in full detail by watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOXsdhZZSdM&list=PL926CA30C6E7D9DCF&index=18).

During the building season, I was a part of the design team. I had to design parts of the electronic board, chasis and the shooter. Our team used Solid Works to design our parts in 3d and print the schematics for the mechanical team to use. During the competition, I was the coach for our drive team. I had to direct the drivers and decide what type of strategy we would use. Even though we only made it to the semifinals, I am still proud of how far I went in my first year of being on the high school robotics team.
