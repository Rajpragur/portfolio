summary: I was in charge of planning a work event for my work place
---

My work place allows our store to plan an annual party each year to celebrate all the hard work the employees do. In 2016, it was my first year as being a manager, so my boss asked if I could plan the event for the year. She explained that my job for planning this event would be finding a place for the party, creating a schedule for the day, planning different games for us to play, working with my boss to create a menu for the party, and other small items such as decorations and party favors. This was my first time planning something relatively big and whe I first looked at what I was tasked to do, I felt a bit overwhelmed. However, I learned that by breaking up this party planning into smaller parts for me to do, I was able to plan this party in 2 months. By the time I had to review everything with my boss, which was a week before the party, I had everything planned out and ready for the day of the party.
