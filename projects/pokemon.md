 POKEMON

This is a text game that I developed with another classmate for a final project.  It is based on the popular Pokemon game.  Random Pokemon appear to the user.  The user then has the option to catch the pokemon, or run.  Caught pokemon can later be displayed in a pokedex menu.

Workload was shared between the two of us.  This project gave me a crash course into developing with github, as well as challenged me to strengthen my java coding skills.  I learned some of the advantages and disadvantages of coding with others.  It was not always easy coordinating times to be able to look at the code together.  While github records all changes made, it is much more helpful to have another set of eyes working alongside you to help debug in real time.  Communication between us was vital, so that each had a role and code would not have to be constantly fiddled with.  On the more coding side of things, I was able to learn a lot about object oriented programming.

I was rather impressed with the way our project turned out.  Having not known a byte of data about coding, it was hard to believe that I could be a part of that.
