While taking Tagalog classes, I used physical flashcards to learn vocabulary. However, keeping track of the cards, creating new cards, and organizing all the cards
proved to be challenging at times. I decided to create a flashcard program. 

This program has the text on the front and back of each flashcard stored in a .csv file. It displays the text from one side of a card and prompts the user for input matching the other 
side of that card. After executing string comparison, the program displays if the user input matched the text. If the user answers incorrectly, the flash card is kept in the active deck 
of cards to be reviewed in that session, while correctly answered cards are longer be used in that session.
