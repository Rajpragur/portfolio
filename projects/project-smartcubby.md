Smart Cubby is a bookshelf-like cubby that interacts with a phone application that I helped create as a team project in EE 296, Fall 2017. The project helped me learn how use an Arduino as well as create simple apps using [MIT App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/).

Smart Cubby was designed using an Arduino to control LED’s, an RFID scanner, an LCD module as a clock. It was implemented using MIT App Inventor, a website platform you can use to create complex android application in a simple way. Within five weeks, we created an app that fully interacted with the Arduino using Bluetooth. The app was used to set a student’s weekly class schedule and set an alarm to wake the student up when they would need to start the day. 

Design
-Bookshelf style approach
-Plexiglass construction
-Has 10 compartments: 1 slot the Arduino microcontroller, 5 slots for textbooks, and 4 slots for miscellaneous items
-Time displayed through LCD
-Two pushbuttons to program the clock
-Individual LEDs per a compartment
-Piezo buzzer alarm
-RFID scanner
-Schedule and LED controller in MIT App Inventor

Android App
-User can program his/her schedule into the app
-User can make edits to an already programed schedule 
-User can  turn off the LEDs

What We Learned
-Advanced app functions (i.e. programmable scheduler) in MIT App Inventor
-App graphic design
-I2C data transfer protocol
-LCD module as a clock
-Piezo buzzer as an alarm
-Plexiglass cutting 
-RFID scanning technology
-Use of a soldering iron
-Charlieplexing
