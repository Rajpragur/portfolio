This Sudoku project was one of the project in ICS211. A Sudoku is a 16x16 grid of integers, each with values 1..9,A,B,C,D,E,F.
Sudoku is valid when each of the 16 columns, each of the 9 rows, and each of the 16 4x4 boxes in the grid has exactly one each of the possible values 1..9,A,B,C,D,E,F, without any duplicates.

In this project, I gained some experiences about recursion and backtracking. recursive is a method to make the problem smaller to solve the problem. what is backtracking? we start with a possiable move out of many moves to try to solve the problem, if we are able to solve the problem then we dont need to backtrack, otherwise, we backtrack and find some other moves to try slove the problem. overall, it was a very impotant experience for me.
