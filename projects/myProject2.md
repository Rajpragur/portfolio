This project is about creating "any" things that involves any human interaction.  I did not need to make a program, but need to think the concept, a target audience, a persona, a sope which is something that the project cannot do, a scenario and testing.  This project's goal is not being able to create an app, but is being able to create a project with clear description and concept, and to think the target audience and make a persona with low-fidelity prototype. 

I decided to think about a bible app which allowed users to highlight, share with friends via socail network, search related verse(s) from the Bible, take a note, and share ideas with other users of the app.  Since this app will be on some devices such as smartphone or tablet, my target audience would be from highschool students to mid-40 because they are familiar with those devices and would like the conbinience of the app. I made all the description and other details, as well as a low-fidelity protptype with some methods called Wizard of Oz and sketchboarding. I tested this project with my friend, and there were severak issues which I would be able to improve this app.
