## Overview
Roomniverse is a web application that was developed as a final project for ICS 314 in the Fall 2021 semester. It serves as a social network for UH students to meet new people and find roommates. When signing up for Roomniverse, you are able to set your name, gender, major, and graduation year, all of which can be edited later on. By signing up for Roomniverse you gain access to the main message board called the "Hub" where you can speak your mind and update your status, the "Find Roommate" where you can find roommates and sort them by major, gender, and graduating class as well as add your own personal roommate request. 

## My Contribution to Roomniverse
Roomniverse was a team project made by [Tracy Bui](https://jubinc0911.github.io/), [Ju-bin Choi](https://jubinc0911.github.io/), [Eric Song](https://eric-song1773.github.io/), [Scott Vore](https://syhv-git.github.io/), and me, [Jonathan Valencia](https://jon-valencia.github.io). I mainly handled the creating the user collections as well as creating the profile card templates each of the users. This used a mixture of MongoDB, Semantic UI React, and Meteor. The user collection stores all user information in objects that can be edited by the user later on and the profile card simply displays the user information objects for each user.

In addition to this, I also handled our projects deployment to the internet through the use of Digital Ocean and Robo 3T.

## Takeaways From Roomniverse
As someone who almost always favored solo projects as opposed to group projects, this was a group project that I thoroughly enjoyed and learned a lot from. Using Git/Github we were able to assign "issues" to each person in the group and create our own separate branches so that we didn't interfere with each other's work (that is until we ran into our first major merge conflict situation). Proper usage of Git/Github made me appreciate group projects and showed me what could be accomplished in such a short time through efficient project management.
