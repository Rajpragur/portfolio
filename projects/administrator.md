SALESFORCE ADMINISTRATOR

Salesforce is a Customer Relationship Management system (CRM) that is a crucial aspect of many of today's largest companies.  Somewhere in the ballpark of 80% of fortune 500 companies use Salesforce when interacting with clients, leads, sales, and the like.  For these reasons, on top of being invested in Salesforce stock, I thought it would be a good idea to delve deeper into what this company is about. I am currently training and studying to be certified as a Salesforce administrator.

This is a goal I am pursuing outside of school.  Being relatively new to the computer world, I am discovering the massive amount of opportunity out there, and am still in search of a passion in this field.  I had to say yes when I was presented this opportunity by local startup, Purple Maiâ€™a.  I am currently about halfway through my training and really excited to be learning something new.  I am hoping that this can translate into one of my first jobs in the computer world and earn me some connections along the way.

A lot of my learning with this project is self directed.  It is helping me to understand research.  It is also giving me a little drive to start considering networking, which is not something I feel specifically interested in.  By taking this on and pushing out of my comfort zone, I feel I have grown immensely over the past few months and hope to continue on this path.
