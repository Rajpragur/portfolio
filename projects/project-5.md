## BACKSTORY:
Growing up, my Uncle Lyman was like a father to me. He would take me fishing, surfing, and teach me all sorts 
of useful and practical things. Uncle Lyman was always a very talented craftsman; he could build and fix anything
and everything. My first exposure to his skill was when I was involved in Boy Scouts. In Boy Scouts, we had an 
annual racecar competition. The point of the competition was to build a small, wooden racecar and race it against the other
scouts. The scouts could receive assistance in building their car from a family member. I remember Uncle Lyman
helped me to build an amazing car. The wood was polished so well that when I touched it, it felt like velvet. He made
the car aerodynamic and fast. I remember our car won the derby that year, all thanks to Uncle Lyman's superior craftsmanship.

The wooden car was just a small sample of his ability. Eventually I would spend time in Uncle Lyman's actual studio:
the place where he made ukuleles. Uncle Lyman builds amazing and world renowned custom ukuleles. He calls his business
Lymana Ukuleles. He would always talk about wanting a website for his business, but could never get one that he was 
satisfied with (formats such as weebly just weren't ideal). Since I now knew HTML/CSS, I decided to make him a website
the good old fashioned way.
