summary: To help promote a local craftsman's ukulele business, I built a website from scratch.

## BACKSTORY:
Growing up, my Uncle Lyman was like a father to me. He would take me fishing, surfing, and teach me all sorts 
of useful and practical things. Uncle Lyman was always a very talented craftsman; he could build and fix anything
and everything. My first exposure to his skill was when I was involved in Boy Scouts. In Boy Scouts, we had an 
annual racecar competition. The point of the competition was to build a small, wooden racecar and race it against the other
scouts. The scouts could receive assistance in building their car from a family member. I remember Uncle Lyman
helped me to build an amazing car. The wood was polished so well that when I touched it, it felt like velvet. He made
the car aerodynamic and fast. I remember our car won the derby that year, all thanks to Uncle Lyman's superior craftsmanship.

The wooden car was just a small sample of his ability. Eventually I would spend time in Uncle Lyman's actual studio:
the place where he made ukuleles. Uncle Lyman builds amazing and world renowned custom ukuleles. He calls his business
Lymana Ukuleles. He would always talk about wanting a website for his business, but could never get one that he was 
satisfied with (formats such as Weebly just weren't ideal). Since I now knew HTML/CSS, I decided to make him a website
the good old fashioned way.

## PROCESS:
Interestingly enough, this project began with searching though reddit. Uncle Lyman first wanted a logo. He wanted something with "an owl and a ukulele." I am not much of a drawer, so instead of trying to draw something on my own, I consulted reddit. I asked the logo subreddit to create what Uncle Lyman had asked for. Eventually a user created something I thought was simple and nice, and Uncle Lyman agreed once I showed him. In today's world, oftentimes knowing how to be resourceful online is incredibly useful.

Now to begin the project of building the actual website, I first began experimenting with HTML and CSS code in the IntelliJ
IDE. I also used the Semantic UI framework to help make working with the HTML and CSS easier (view my essay on my Semantic UI experience here). Eventually, after a lot of trial-and-error, I managed to create something I was satisfied with. Even though the website was not completely refined, I decided to leave it as be because of I felt it had some charm and character.
