This application was made as a final project for ICS 314 (Software Engineering) at UH Manoa. It was designed to have similar functions as craigslist, but to be used by UH Manoa students. We wanted to create an application where UH Manoa students can easily sell items that other students may need, but in a safe way where they did not have to leave campus.  


I learned a lot about c++ when creating this program, which is why I chose to include it. This was a hard program for me to write, even though there was no complex algorithms or hard concepts involved. It was hard for me because I did not have much previous knowledge about c++, and reading resources about this language online can be confusing at times. Writing this program made me appreciate having less features in c. I learned a lot about c++, but most importantly that it is not a language for me.
