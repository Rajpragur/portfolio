## The Start

At the end of our Software Engineering course, we had a final group project due. The goal was to create a functional website that utilizes all the skills and information that we learned throughout the course. Not only did we have to create a functioning website, but we also had to document the milestones we achieved in a GitHub page, which can be viewed<a href="https://munchiezone.github.io/">here.</a>
