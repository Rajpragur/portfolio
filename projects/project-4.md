This application was made as a final project for ICS 314 (Software Engineering) at UH Manoa. It was designed to have similar functions as craigslist, but to be used by UH Manoa students. We wanted to create an application where UH Manoa students can easily sell items that other students may need, but in a safe way where they did not have to leave campus.  

The team that created this application consisted of Braden Betz, Hoyeon Jang, Mark Matsuoka, and myself. We split the work up by completing different pages of the application, and making different components used by the pages. The parts of the project that I completed were the report system, the different category pages, and the pages to sell/edit items. 

This project was a great learning experience for me. It showed me how important it is to clearly communicate with your group, and to have a written document to keep track of everyone's responsibilities. There were times where ideas about the application were not clear, so people did unnecessary work when working on related issues. This could have been avoided if we started off with better communication and clear expectations. Having a document of everyone's responsibilities was a great way to keep track of what they needed to do, and what they could expect from others. We used GitHub to document our project, making issues that would describe a task that needed to be done. We could see what issues each group member was working on, which gave us a good estimate of when things would get completed. I believe that without using GitHub to document our project, we would have not been able to complete it at same efficiency.
