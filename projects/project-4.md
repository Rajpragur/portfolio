## The Start

At the end of our Software Engineering course, we had a final group project due. The goal was to create a functional website that utilizes all the skills and information that we learned throughout the course. Not only did we have to create a functioning website, but we also had to document the milestones we achieved in a GitHub page, which can be viewed <a href="https://munchiezone.github.io/">here.</a>

Each milestone in the project contained multiple issues to work on so that the website could be slowly completed. The first milestone was the aesthetics of the website, so mockup web pages were created so that the group could get an idea of what the website would look like before we began implementing backend code. 
The issue that I was designated for was to work on the landing page for munchie zone. I used the professor's example project <a href="https://bowfolios.github.io/">Bowfolios</a>as a template. The color scheme was inspired by the Munchie Zone github.io page. The goal of the landing page was to entice new users to try out the website. The landing page explains the purpose of the website and how to use the website, then leads the user to login. Unfortunately, the website can only be accessed by authorized University of Hawaii at Manoa accounts because the website is for testing, not for actual use.
