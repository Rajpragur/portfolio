summary: A reactive website created for the UH Manoa community in ICS 314.
---

Manoa Exchange was created with the UH Community in mind. The purpose was to create a website that only the UH community could use to buy and sell products. It was mainly geared to those that were in the dormitory or another housing nearby and either wanted to sell their furniture or one of their other items, or buy one from someone that didn't want it. Users were free to sell anything they wanted though, only if it was appropriate. The admin was allowed to edit and delete items and accounts depending on reports submitted by other users, otherwise, they could participate too.
