I first entered FIRST my last year in high school. FIRST is a national robotics competition which high school teams compete in the sport of science and technology.

Our team, 2443, had to build and operate a robot. We first started with management and design. We had our own positions and had a complete design of how the robot was to be made.
I was one of many programmers on the team. I had to code parts of the program so the robot could move and shoot. In the end we made it to finals and competed with the best teams around the world.

It was a wonderful experience that taught me a lot about programming and working as a team to complete an insane 3 month project.
