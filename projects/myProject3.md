This assignment is for ICS464 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  The project was assigned to think some device to prevent babies or infants from being forgatton in a car for some reasons.  This device could be used with a car seat or something portable and so forth.  With the device, I needed to descrive a concept of the car seat devicec and its conceptual model in detail.  Also, I needed to pick a metaphor for the device as most of the materials, devices or products came from not out of nowhere, but from some metaphors.  

My concept or idea for this device is a two way signal pressurizes baby alert system with metaphors that are passenger seat belt warning sign which goes off when there is a pressure on the seat and the belt is not buckled, and a wireless keychain device, which the new car model has, that unlocks the car when a person with the device gets near and locks when he or she goes away.  I also think what kind of materials to use and how it works.  If I could actually build this device in the future, it would help parents from forgetting their babies and causing them to have a critical condition.

You can find the code for this project from [GitHub](https://github.com/minakod/ICS/blob/master/ICS464_carseat.doc).
