## **ROOMBRAH**

Roombrah is a project I worked on in ICS 111 where you have a roomba navigate around a room and collect dirt as it passes over it. The game completes once the roomba collects all the dirt. The project was made in java with the help of the resource package ez.java. Here is a [Youtube Link](https://youtu.be/R8NAsBJUOyI) that shows the program in action. This was my second coding project and helped teach me collisions and random generators in java. It also helped me learn simple map design and building.
