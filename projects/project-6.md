## INTRODUCTION:
For my Software Engineering class, my final project was to create some type of web app for the university within a team. After some thinking, my team and I decided we wanted to work with the maintenance department and help them out
in some way. The idea we had was to create an app that would be able to create and organize repair reports online. We thought this would be useful to the department and could help increase the department's overall efficiency. 

## PROCESS
Over several weeks, my team and I worked on this project, coding and making small adjustments to the site. We logged all of our progress through Github's Project Board system and also managed a Github Page to document the project. The basic premise of the app is that General Users can add reports and view a listing of reports, while Admins have the power to edit and remove reports. Also, I put some PayPal and Cloudinary integration into the site. Overall this was a great learning experience between working with a team and the actual coding itself.

## RESULT
You can view the live app on Galaxy [here](http://manoafixed.meteorapp.com/#/).
You can view the Project Page [here](https://manoa-fixed.github.io/).
You can view the Github repo [here](https://github.com/manoa-fixed).
