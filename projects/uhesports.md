Competitive gaming or esports is a global phenomenon that has taken the world by storm in the last decade or so. For years people have gathered in the thousands (before COVID) to experience the excitement that is esports. My story in esports started in the game Call of Duty, I followed a team called OpTic Gaming, a fan favorite in the scene. What got me hooked was hearing the crowd roar whenever a big play was made or just hearing them chant their name, "LET'S GO OPTIC" *clap clap clapclapclap*. 

What got me in to UH Esports was a game called Overwatch. It was the beginning of the Spring 2019 semester and they were hosting their inaugural tryouts for their Overwatch team and while I'm not the best I felt like I could hold my own so my friend and I went to the tryouts and ended up making it on the team. My time on the Overwatch team has led me to meet many people that I can call my friends and has opened doors to opportunities that I never thought I would ever have in my life, but here we are over two and half years later.
