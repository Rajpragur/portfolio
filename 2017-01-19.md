The short course in freecampcode covers a basic understanding of JavaScript and the simplicity of the materials gave me an insight to the different syntax when compared to other languages. I have taken a two other courses that taught programming in C++ and so the concepts weren't that foreign to me.

The course didn't include object oriented programming yet, and as I look further into the curriculum, there was a section that covers just that. The interface with the user is straight forward. However, if I was never expose to programming, the program doesn't provide the necessary help I would need. There were times when I was stuck on a task and from my perspective, the available resources didn't come of much use. Part of the fault was due to insufficient instructions. Overall, the learning style was self-taught in a sense and after accomplishing the module, it is rewarding since it is another addition for your knowledge of programming language under skillsets.

JavaScript from I have been told, is the language for the future and the bread and butter for web application development. According to reviews from different tech article and developer forums, JavaScript is an extremely marketable language. From statistics, software development jobs are vastly growing throughout the nation with the demand to become proficient with JavaScript. The language provides variety of resources and tools that provide dynamic data structures, object oriented programming for prototyping and functionality that is simple and versatile. Consistency and practice will deepen my knowledge of the language and I know the end product of my future projects will come with ease with JS.

Exercises in class with WOD is a good aptitude method to test my understanding of the materials. I enjoy it and welcome the pressure under time constraints as it will help me become better at what I do.
