## Who I am


I am a native of England, resident in the Pacific north west of the USA. I am employed as a Senior Business Analyst at a global logistics company, where I am the product owner for configuration management process and tools. I teach basic and advanced Python programming, and business analysis, at a leading US university. I run my own tutoring and coaching business.



Why I do this


I have observed a lack of really good career learning and development resources, particularly those targetted at beginners. Such resources seem to start off in a really basic way, and then quickly get too deep and complex too quickly. There is a strong tendency to position things from the insiders' or experts' view points, rather than describing context, what, and why before diving in to how. Technologists do tend to obsess on technology itself. I obsess on technology applied to solving real business problems as quickly as possible.



What I can do for you


I can help you learn how to learn effectively, and grow your skills. You can learn general skills, or specifics in Python development and business analysis. I am also a certified career coach, and can help you plan the evolution of your career.
