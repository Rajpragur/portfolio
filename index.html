<p><img align="left" alt="" src="/images/analysis.png" width="25%"></p>
<p>There has probably never been a time in the history of information technology where the business analyst role has been more important. Long established organizations, and even entire industries, are being transformed radically at an ever-increasing pace. Retailing is now very different to what it was even 5 years ago. Insurance, personal transportation and accommodation too. Choice for consumers is significantly greater than ever before.</p>
<p>Organization performance and reputation are highly visible. Helping organizations to change and adapt rapidly, and reducing the risk of doing the wrong thing, are critical success factors.</p>
<p>Analysis is a valuable skill to learn in any job role. It is also widely applicable in day to day life.</p>
<h2>Careers</h2>
<p><img align="left" alt="" src="/images/andy-cert.png" width="35%"></p>
<p>The obvious ways to approach job hunting, writing resumes (CVs in Europe) and creating cover letters will lead to obvious results. Obvious results might be succussful. But with a little effort you can differentiate yourself and increase your success rate.</p>
<p>We have experience as both a certified career coach and a hiring professional in many leadin organizations. We help you differentiate yourself, which increases your chance of success.</p>
<p>We can also help you identify the right career for you.</p>
