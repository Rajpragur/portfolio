<h2>Our mission</h2>
<p>We eliminate unnecessary complexity, so you are able to use technology to deliver value to your stakeholders.</p>
<p>You will become more confident, and will improve your knowledge in your chosen subject. We are passionate about helping anyone become more proficient and successful. No level of knowledge is too little to get started with us! Prior experince is not necessary.</p>
<h2>Python</h2>
<p><img align="left" alt="" src="/images/python.png" width="35%"></p>
<p>Python is an exciting language. It can be easy for you to learn, but only with the right tuition. We deeply understand how to explain and transfer that knowledge to you. </p>
<p>We firmly believe that difficulty in learning Python is caused by poor teaching, not a defficiency of any kind in the student.</p>
<p>Often, basic concepts are ommited from lesson content. We see many students who strucggle because this, and who feel like they "just don't get it".</p>
<p>Our proven mthods with may students helps you to overcome challenga with the basics, and then we help ypu move on to understand the more advance material.</p>
<p>We also help you to understand how to tackle seeminly complex assignments, so that you can make progress, without feeling at a loss to now what to do!</p>
<h2>Analyis</h2>
<p><img align="left" alt="" src="/images/analysis.png" width="25%"></p>
<p>There has probably never been a time in the history of information technology where the business analyst role has been more important. Long established organizations, and even entire industries, are being transformed radically at an ever-increasing pace. Retailing is now very different to what it was even 5 years ago. Insurance, personal transportation and accommodation too. Choice for consumers is significantly greater than ever before.</p>
<p>Organization performance and reputation are highly visible. Helping organizations to change and adapt rapidly, and reducing the risk of doing the wrong thing, are critical success factors.</p>
<p>Analysis is a valuable skill to learn in any job role. It is also widely applicable in day to day life.</p>
<h2>Careers</h2>
<p><img align="left" alt="" src="/images/andy-cert.png" width="35%"></p>
<p>The obvious ways to approach job hunting, writing resumes (CVs in Europe) and creating cover letters will lead to obvious results. Obvious results might be succussful. But with a little effort you can differentiate yourself and increase your success rate.</p>
<p>We have experience as both a certified career coach and a hiring professional in many leadin organizations. We help you differentiate yourself, which increases your chance of success.</p>
<p>We can also help you identify the right career for you.</p>  </div>
