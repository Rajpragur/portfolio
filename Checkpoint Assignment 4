1. Describe the web-application you intend to build (in detail please!)
I'm working on the back-end of the e-commerce store "Morning Brew". My goal is to allow an admin to login and change anything they desire. Whether it be the price of an item, replacing an item, adding an item, anything that the client would like to be able to do. 

2. Indicate how you expect the application will make use of the required technical complexity items (e.g. file I/O, sessions, multi-dimensional arrays, etc.)
The web application is very much so like assignment 2 where you would need to use file I/O, CSS/HTML5, Loops/Conditionals and Multi-dimensional arrays. If we need to add sessions and cookies, maybe we'll set up something where it would automatically logout the admin after a certain amount of time to ensure privacy and security using cookies and sessions. 
3. What is your plan to ensure you successfully complete your project before the end of the semester?
My plan is to start early and begin collaborating with my group members and meeting up so that we'll be able to complete this task. 
4. What progress have you made so far and what is left for you to do?
I'm currently working on making a fake front-end of the store so that we will be able to test and use that data for the back end of the e-commerce store.
