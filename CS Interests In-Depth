## INTRODUCTION:

I chose Computer Science because it is a growing and demanding field, and I also genuinely enjoy the subject. Before taking ICS courses, my idea of the subject was that it was boring and tedious work, however I couldn't have been more wrong once I actually started taking classes.
Computer Science is akin to problem solving. Growing up, I have always have had an interest in puzzles; tests of my natural instincts and ability to think outside the box. This is what I enjoy about Computer Science, how it is such a flexible subject and allows for much creativity. 
A lot of the concepts we learn can also be applied to other fields, such as another science or even design. At the end of the day, Computer Science helps me become a better thinker and problem solver.

## SECURITY:

My interest in security stems from the strategic aspect of it; it seems to be incorporate ideas of espionage as well as general thrill. As a cherry on top, it is also a lucrative field with a lot of demand. I want to learn more about how to engineer better privacy techniques into the
digital world we live in. Security also asks a lot of social and ethical types of questions: What exactly is privacy? What is right and wrong in terms of sharing personal information? What should companies and governments be allowed to know about a person? We live in a world where a lot of 
our lives are stored online. How do we design security practices that are fair for everyone?

## INFORMATION SYSTEMS:

Information Systems and Security go hand-in-hand. Information Systems are organizational systems that are engineered to process, store, and distribute information. In Computer Science, these typically include things like databases and servers. Information Systems are integral to any sort
of modern business, and knowing how to operate them is crucial to help the organization run smoothly. I guess you can say that my interest in Information Systems stretches even beyond computer systems to those of the biological sort. What I mean is I have an interest in information systems
found in nature, such as genetics and neuroscience, if those can be considered as such. These days, Computer Science seems to overlap with these other subjects. I have such a great interest in these subjects that maybe one day I can learn more.

## PROGRAMMING:

I decided to list simple programming as an interest. I want to learn how to become a better and more efficient programmer. I want to learn as many languages as I can, and understand the pros and cons to each. Initially, I did not really enjoy programming. However, I have grown to like it more 
and more. I feel the act of programming is akin to playing an instrument. If you aren't good at it, it isn't too much fun and is rather painful to do. However the better you get, the more fun it is. Once you reach a certain aptitude, the act of it becomes enjoyable to the point where it evolves
into a hobby. At least that is my experience with both programming and music. Looking forward, hopefully I can continue to create great things.
