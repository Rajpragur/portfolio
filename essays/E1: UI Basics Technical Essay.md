Introduction : 

  My experience with these WODS has been very educational. When I first looked at the assignment, it seemed easy. The assignment was asking to do the code on your own on the first attempt and if you take too long (DNF'd) then you look at the screencast and try again without references opened. However, I tried doing these without having done the readings. So obviously, I DNF'd all first attempts on my own and didn't make it much far. However, after watching the screencast I learned a lot but was still confused on some concepts like what does h1/h2 mean, or what is an anchor or what an href was. If I had done the readings I think I would've been better off in my first attempt because I would understand what the instructions wanted me to do. 
  
  For the first WOD, it was simple for the first few steps then the instructions got a little hazy when they were asking me to link things. Had I done the reading, I would've thought of href's but since I didn't, I got stuck and that took out a lot of time for the first attempt of my WOD1. After watching the screencast, it made a lot more sense and having done it the 2nd time, I was able to finish within AV. I learned how to link browser sites using href as well as icons using img src. 
  
  For the second WOD, it was the same as the first WOD attempt. The first couple of instructions were clear but when I had to link my style.css to my index.html, that's where I struggled and didn't know how to do it. But after watching the screencast, I learned that there's a link rel = "stylesheet" href = "style.css" code that links your style sheet to the index.html file. Then I was completely lost at instruction 6 because I didn't know how to implement any of the fonts, colors or width/height to my style sheet but when I watched the screencast a lot of it made sense and found that style sheets are easy to configure to make your webpage look nicer and cleaner. I was able to finish the 2nd attempt within AV and I learned the basics of styling a style.css sheet. 
  
 For the last WOD, I attempted this a total of 3 times. What made it difficult was adding the div in the right area's. They had to embody the content I wanted it in and I missed that twice so that's why I DNF'd. However, on the third try I was able to watch the screencast again before I attempted and saw where my mistake was. However, once the index.html file was done, I learned that the CSS file was a lot easier to code and understand. For example, having to configure the #navbar to your liking using margin-left/right when the <div is in the right place in the index.html file.
