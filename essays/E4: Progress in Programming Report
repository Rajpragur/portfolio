E4: Progress in Programming Report

As the semester comes to an end, I have noticed that I must work ten times harder to improve my programming skills. Though I have learned a lot through completing the Workout of the Days (WODs) I still continue to struggle. Coding takes a lot of understanding of which I have yet to do. I can not confidently complete the WODs without having the screencast on another tab. Though I have tried not pulling up the screencast, I would just take way too long. The labs definitely have helped me throughout the semester, however since Professor Kazman changed his teaching style a bit to make us a little more independent it has been quite difficult to learn. Though I know that this teaching style is better for us in the long run and allows us more room to troubleshoot our own issues, it is not enjoyable and extremely stressful. I have learned that I must begin Assignment 2 as soon as I can because waiting til the last minute to ask for help will ultimately make things harder for myself. What helps me the most is Professor Kazmanâ€™s office hours, in the future, I plan to use more of that.
