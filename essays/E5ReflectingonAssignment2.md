<p>Assignment 2 was mainly about creating a login/registration page and allowing users to carry there data througout the pages to get to the invoice. For information on the assignment please reference <a href=https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/modules/Assignment2> this site </a></p>

<p>This assignment taught me a lot about servers and how to use a server to carry the data through the pages. It also helped me reinforce my knowledge on html, css, and javascript, in order to update my website.</p>

<p>The hardest part was trying to stay aware of where the data is and how to carry it over from page to page. I needed a lot of help and referenced the internet many times to refresh my knowledge on specific codes. Other than this, I went back and forth with Professor Daniel Port and my friend who had taken this class last semester. </p>

<p>The biggest difference between this assignment and assigment 1 was the fact that everything was being done on a server.js which made things a little tricker. The funniest part was that 10% of the time was spent on trying to think about what code was needed, 40% of the time was spent actually creating the code, and 50% of the time was spent staring at the screen trying to debug what was wrong with how I was carrying the data. </p>

<p>Ultimately, I think in this project I can confidently say that I have mastered html to the best of my current ability. The things that I need to work on is being critical of every detail and being aware of little issues as I go along because they are a lot harder to find when I am completely done writing the entire code. That is why if I could go back in time I would double/triple check my work within the process of writing the code rather than writing it all and trying to determine what was wrong after.</p>
