I've always loved creating things, either it be writing or drawing. That satisfaction of struggling through not being satisfied with your work and making it the way you want it. It's such an amazing feeling when you finally finish and it turns out right. This is the feeling I have when I'm coding. 

I love the satisfaction and breath of relief I have at the end of a long and tiresome process of coding. I like having a bit of a challenge and having to think things through. Puzzles is something that I have always liked, and coding is just like that. It's both an art form and technical writing. By figuring out how the application works and breaking it down into small subsections and translating it into code, I genuinely have fun doing it. 

I hope to be able to be a better problem solver when working on projects, either it be for school, work, or personal. Being a better problem solver would mean that I would be able to piece different codes together a lot better than before and figure how a certain action should be programmed to better enhance the efficiency.
