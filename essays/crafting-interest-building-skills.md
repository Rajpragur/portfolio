# Crafts

I've always loved creating things, either it be writing or drawing. I loved coming up with ideas and having the ability to put it out onto paper. I've had years of experience creating things. While not all of them came out the way I had wanted it to come out, and still some just aren't right, the satisfaction of struggling and making tweaks and fixing errors until it _does,_ makes it worth while. It's such an amazing feeling when you finally finish and it turns out the way you want it to. This is the same feeling I have when I'm coding something.

# Builds

I love the satisfaction and breath of relief I have at the end of a long and tiresome process of coding. I like having that challenge and having to struggle and think things through. Puzzles is something that I have always liked, and coding is just like that. It's both an art form and technical writing. Figuring out how the application works and breaking it down into small subsections and translating it into code and trying to piece it together, I genuinely have fun doing it. 

# Future

I hope to be able to be a better problem solver when working on projects, either it be for school, work, or personal. Being a better problem solver would mean that I would be able to piece different codes together a lot better than before and figure out how a certain action should be programmed to better enhance the efficiency.
