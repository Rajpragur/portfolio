Relationships will always start with a "Hello". Usually they are followed by an introduction and hopefully with a smile. A "Hello" can start a conversation or it can start a passion. In my intoductory class to computer science, our first assignment was to make our computer say "Hello World!". Mostly all introductory classes do it, and it may seem really simple but to me it filled me with excitement. Imagining myself telling a computer to do anything I want and it will do it is incredible. When I am programming I feel as if I am talking to the computer and when the program runs exactly as I expect it to I feel like the computer understood me. I have developed a relationship with all computers!
