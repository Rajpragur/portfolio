## Programming Languages (C/C++/Java)

  Being introduced to a new programming language is always exciting. Learning new syntax, ways that programming language can be appropriate for different problems, how variables will act and get moved around, and a new way of controlling and creating objects. Throughout my semesters as a Computer Science major, I have learned C/C++ and Java are two very different programming languages. They can both accomplish the same tasks, but certain tasks are easier for a given programming languages. Java i found it great introduction to Computer Science. In my two semesters i spent learning java, we used a program named JGrasp. In this program, it was easy for coders to easily compile and run their code. If any errors seem to come up, there would be an error checker that will tell you exactly where you went wrong. On the other hand, C++, it was difficult to compile and run code on a terminal, and if any errors would occur, it wouldn't exactly be code-friendly to pinpoint where your code had the wrong syntax. However, i found C/C++ to be fun in a way. Navigating through folders and programs through a terminal made it easy to find files and link them to your code. I also found C/C++ to be able to be more in control of your device. All programing languages have their uses, its their pros and cons that are specific to the coder. However to me, it does not seem right to classify them as good as bad as they all have a learning curve associated with them. 
  
### Coding in Javascript
  
  This semester, I take a dive into Javascript. Having no prior knowledge or experience working with Javascript, the modules, WODS, i have worked on so far, coding in Java is very user-friendly. Being able to start writing code without any main method makes it very fast to use. For example, Java would need "public static void main(string[] args){}" for every program made. C++ would have a similar main method. In Javascript, i like that you are able to write functions right from the get-go which makes the in-class WOD's very fun. Although it does not matter how fast you complete the WOD's as long as you fnish it. I also like to enjoy some personal competition to see who can finish writing codes the fastest. Also this style allows me to read the WOD for the day, and really think about the functions, loops, if/else statements i'm about to write in my program. However, this can be very stressful finishing an algorithm within a certain amount of time, i know this type of stress will help me in the real world where in companies, Developers and Computer Scientists will not have all the time in the world to complete a project. There might be times where i'd have to fix bugs on the get-go on certain company websites, or security breaches. Having to work all throughout my high school and college years, i find it useful to continually put ourselves into these stressful situations in order work effeciently and get the job done.
