  Being introduced to a new programming language is always exciting. Learning new syntax, ways that programming language can be appropriate for different problems, how variables will act and get moved around, and a new way of controlling and creating objects. Throughout my semesters as a Computer Science major, I have learned C/C++ and Java are two very different programming languages. They can both accomplish the same tasks, but certain tasks are easier for a given programming languages. Java i found it great introduction to Computer Science. In my two semesters i spent learning java, we used a program named JGrasp. In this program, it was easy for coders to easily compile and run their code. If any errors seem to come up, there would be an error checker that will tell you exactly where you went wrong. On the other hand, C++, it was difficult to compile and run code on a terminal, and if any errors would occur, it wouldn't exactly be code-friendly to pinpoint where your code had the wrong syntax. However, i found C/C++ to be fun in a way. Navigating through folders and programs through a terminal made it easy to find files and link them to your code. I also found C/C++ to be able to be more in control of your device. All programing languages have their uses, its their pros and cons that are specific to the coder. However to me, it does not seem right to classify them as good as bad as they all have a learning curve associated with them. 
  
  This semester, I take a dive into Javascript. Having no prior knowledge or experience working with Javascript
