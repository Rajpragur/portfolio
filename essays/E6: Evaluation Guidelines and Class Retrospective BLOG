For my Assignment 3 I did my best to improve my e-commerce store (apple). I am really proud of my aesthetic of the website, however I was not able to complete the project the way I had hoped I could. I had trouble sending the invoice to my email once I was trying to purchase the products. I am very glad that I was able to complete most of the requirements. In the previous reflection I stated that I would ask for more help but I didnâ€™t, which in the end really could have saved me. If I could go back and change anything I would have definitely worked with a partner so that I would be able to split up the work but also ask for their help when I did not know how to do specific tasks.
