## What are Ethics?

   The dictionary definition of ethics is "moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity". This definition can be applied to every aspect of a person's life, and every decision a person makes. There are two main forms of ethics, professional ethics and personal ethics. These two tend to overlap, and can get messy at times. The topic that I wanted to expand on was ethics in software engineering. This would fall under professional ethics, and could also clash with personal ethics at times. When considering ethics in software engineering, it is important to consider how your work will affect the safety of others, and if your work will create a positive impact on society. There are many situations that can occur due to the work you produce and how you produce it. Even if you created software that created a positive impact on society, such as software that could help detect cancer, it could still be unethical. There could be a bug in the software that caused it to not work on people with certain blood types, causing people to go months untreated for cancer. This would be highly unethical due to the software negatively affecting the safety of others. 

## Softare Engineering and JavaScript

  I currently do not know much about Software Engineering or JavaScript, so I also do not know how good JavaScript will be in a Sowftware Engineering perspective. My guess is that due to JavaScript's flexibility, it will be a great language in this perspective. There is so much creativity that can go into making software, so I can understand how other languages might not be as ample as JavaScript. I am excited to learn more about both topics, and have so far really enjoyed my time in this class.

## Class Structure

  The "athletic" approach to teaching this class is very fascinating. I was nervous for our first work out of the day(wod), but it did not end up being that hard. I really enjoyed the practice wods so far, since they prepared me to complete the first wod before the dnf time. It is also fun to retry the practice wods to get better times, kind of like a game. I think it's important to practice every day if you want to be good at something, no matter what the skill is. These small exercises get me to regularly use my brain and think for a little bit. The only downside to this style of learning is the amount of time it can take. I am also enrolled in ICS 311 this semester. The combination of these classes has already made me start to lose my mind, and it is only the end of week 2(please send your prayers). I know that if I put in the time every week and follow the schedule, that this system will work for me. My biggest struggle will be to balance classes and work with the amount of homework that is given so far, but I will try my best!
