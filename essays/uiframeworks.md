## **INTRO**
Are you using only raw HTML and CSS to build your website and tired of it looking plain and boring? Do you want to make your website look modern and trendy? If you answered yes, I have the solution for you. If you answered no, stick around and I may just change your mind. The easiest way to make your website look more modern is by using a UI framework. Don't know what a UI framework is? Neither did I just a few weeks ago, but after I learned about it, the way I build websites has changed forever.

## **What is a UI Framework?**
The "UI" in "UI Framework" stand for user interface, and it is used to help create the front-end display of an application quicker. Raw CSS and HTML is good if you want to build quick and simple websites, but if you want a beautiful UI, one that will catch people's eye, a UI framework is a tremendous resource to use. You can think of a UI framework as a storage of templates that are easily customizable to make it unique to you. Popular UI frameworks include Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation, Materialize, Semantic UI, and more! There is a multitude of UI frameworks out there and each have their own advantages, so do your research and see which one is best for you and what you are trying to do.

## **Semantic UI**
Semantic UI is the first and only UI framework I have experience with as it is the framework that was chosen to be used for my software engineering class. After only a few weeks of using it, there is noticable improvements in the quality of how my websites look compared to my websites that were built with raw CSS and HTML. Semantic UI is a fairly simple to use, and yet very powerful. I say that is is fairly simple to use because most of the syntax is pretty straightforward, meaning that if you wanted to add an image that is centered, it is as simple as:
```
<img class="ui centered medium image"
     src="http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f19/morea/ui-frameworks/wod-dvine-logo.png">
```
As you can see, the syntax can be as simple as saying what you want the specific item to do. While this won't work all the time, semantic ui has a [website](https://semantic-ui.com/introduction/getting-started.html) with documentation and example code of how to use certain classes that is easy to navigate.

## **Overall**
UI frameworks are a great a tool to use when designing a website as they make it easy to create beautiful front-end displays. There can be a fairly big learning curve, especially when your code is not behaving how you expected or wanted it to. This is because it is a framework, and so a lot of the work is being done behind the scenes and when it is not working, you need to read the documentation to figure out where it is going wrong. It can also get confusing knowing which classes and its content take precedence over another. However, once you get past the struggles, UI frameworks are a powerful tool that can improve the look of your website in just a few minutes.
