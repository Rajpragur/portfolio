## **What is a UI Framework?**
The "UI" in "UI Framework" stand for user interface, and it is used to help create the front-end display of an application quicker. Raw CSS and HTML is good if you want to build quick and simple websites, but if you want a beautiful UI, one that will catch people's eye, a UI framework is a tremendous resource to use. You can think of a UI framework as a storage of templates that are easily customizable to make it unique to you. Popular UI frameworks include Twitter Bootstrap, Foundation, Materialize, Semantic UI, and more! There is a multitude of UI frameworks out there and each have their own advantages, so do your research and see which one is best for you and what you are trying to do.

## **Semantic UI**
Semantic UI is the first and only UI framework I have experience with as it is the framework that was chosen to be used for my software engineering class. After only a few weeks of using it, there is noticable improvements in the quality of how my websites look compared to my websites that were built with raw CSS and HTML. Semantic UI is a fairly simple to use, and yet very powerful. I say that is is fairly simple to use because most of the syntax is pretty straightforward, meaning that if you wanted to add an image that is centered, it is as simple as:
```
<img class="ui centered medium image"
     src="http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f19/morea/ui-frameworks/wod-dvine-logo.png">
```
As you can see, the syntax can be as simple as saying what you want the specific item to do.
