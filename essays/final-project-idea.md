## Career Fair Map Upgrade
Collaboration between Christian Cheshire and Andrea Narciso

### Overview
#### The Problem
The paper map and directory used by students at the career fair is incredibly outdated. One page shows a map of the numbered tables with an index connecting the company names to the numbers. Another page shows all of the companies in attendance, what they do and positions they are offering to UH students. The last page shows all of the different industries and the companies with departments in those respective industries. This matching process creates a headache for students and is detrimental to the career fair experience.

#### The Solution
The solution is to create an interactive web application that connects all of the previously mentioned information at each career fair. This would provide an online website platform for the career center to input all of the information into a database. It would then display a map of the career fair, linking each table to a company, information about what they do and positions they are offering. It would also allow the user to filter through the tables and companies according to their industry or desired position category.

### Mockup page ideas
1. Landing Page
2. User (Student) Profile page: select interests
3. Admin (Career Center) page: add tables and company information
4. Events: linking to each of the career fair maps
5. Map: Showing the information to each career fair
6. Log In: Users and Admin

### Case ideas
User: Landing Page --> Log In --> User Profile Page --> Events --> Map
Admin: Landing --> Log In --> Admin page

### Beyond the basics
- Company Log In: Career Center provides access to companies participating who can then update the information on the web application
- Users can add notes to each booth/table, maybe even a direct link to the LinkedIn, the email addresses of the employers or applications to available positions
- Show users past interactions at previous career fairs with each Company
- FAQs for each company that students can ask and employers can answer in real time
- 5 star rating for each company showing UH graduates employed, retention rate, happiness scale, salary by position
