## Overview

Problem:  No central location for activities of on-campus or near-campus activities
Solution: Create centralized hub for students to find activities within walking distance of campus

## Mockup page ideas

Some possible mockup pages include:

Landing page
User home page
Admin home page
User profile page
Friends page
Calendar page
Event page
  
## Use case ideas

New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile.
User looks for and adds friends. 
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
Admin logs in, gets home page, adds/deletes/edits event.
User filters/sorts events by keywords (e.g. 21+, music, performance, comedy, etc.)
User finds an event they like, and indicates they plan to go to that event.
User looks for events that friends have indicated they will be going to.
  
## Beyond the basics

User creates a meetup addendum to an event to see what other friends would like to go.
User can submit recommendation for event to be added to schedule, which then notifies admins.
Allow users to rate/give reviews to events.
Allow users to contact event coordinator/representative by email.
Allow users to message/email friends who have approved friend request.
Verify UH ID to be displayed as "verified user"
