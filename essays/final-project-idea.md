<h1>Final Project Brainstorm</h1>
While preparing for a practice WOD, we were prompted by a new task in proposing a solution for all computer science majors at UH Manoa. The following includes
the problem to address and the strategy in solving it. Brought to you by Taylor Wong and myself, from ICS 314.

<h3>Overview</h3>
Every student needs a place to share ideas and projects, to lean on one another and learn from each other. It helps promote creativity and a space for novel ideas
to be shared. However, at UH Manoa, Computer Science students do not have this sort of space. As programmers, we need constant project ideas and inspiration, but we can only
come up with so much on our own. That's why, Taylor and I have proposed a solution. We can create a site that allows students to share projects and showcase them. 
By doing this, students will have a place where they can ask questions, gain experience, and solidify their knowledge to prepare them for the industry.

<h3>Mockup Page Ideas</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Homepage, navbar, search/dropdown topics, login/signup</li>
  <li>Projects page</li>
  <li>Post idea page</li>
  <li>Comments/questions page</li>
 </ol>

<h3>Case Ideas</h3>
<ol>
  <li>User goes to homepage and logs in to their account</li>
  <li>User searches for specific project tags (gaming, data, etc.)</li>
  <li>Led to a page with projects that have the corresponding project tags</li>
  <li>User clicks on a project that leads to a page with more information</li>
  <li>Underneath the project showcase, there's a comment section if user has questions or feedback</li>
  <li>User clicks on "post new idea" and gets sent to the "post idea page", a form with predetermined content fields</li>
  <li>User clicks on their profile and it shows their own projects. Also allows for deletion of their projects</li>
</ol>


<h3>Beyond the Basics</h3>
Once basic features are implemented, here's some ideas for a more advanced and robust site
<ol>
  <li>Forums tailored to specific tags/topics</li>
  <li>Rating system, weekly highlights</li>
  <li>Difficulty rating/recommended classes</li>
</ol>
