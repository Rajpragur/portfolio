## Overview

Problem:  No central location for activities of on-campus or near-campus activities
Solution: Create centralized hub for students to find activities within walking distance of campus

## Mockup page ideas

Some possible mockup pages include:

Landing page
User home page
Admin home page
User profile page
Friends page
Calendar/Events page
Group meetup page
  
  
## Use case ideas

Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile, looks for and adds friends. (How do they learn how system works?)
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site.
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, adds/deletes/edits event.
User goes to landing page, logs in, and looks for events to go to and indicates they plan to go to that event.
User goes to landing page, logs in, and looks for events that friends have indicated they will be going to.
  
## Beyond the basics

User creates a meetup addendum to an event to see what other friends would like to go.
User can submit recommendation for event to be added to schedule, which then notifies admins.
Allow students to rate/give reviews to events.
