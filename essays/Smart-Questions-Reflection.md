This week I started to learn about open source software, which is a great tool to collaborate and help with others throughout the world. The best way to receive help is to ask smart questions. I was able to read an article called “How to Ask Questions the Smart Way” by Eric Steven Raymond. The article had important information that could help others ask smart questions, but I did not appreciate the author’s writing style. The useful information in the article was clouded by the unnecessary rudeness from Raymond. It was very off-putting to me, and if it were not for me having to read the article for school, I would not have finished reading it. If Raymond wrote in a more positive style, I believe more people would appreciate the topic he was talking about, and implement it when they ask questions. Regardless of his writing style, I will be going over an example of what I think is a smart question and what is not a smart question, based on Raymond’s article.



## Bad Question

This is the first question I would like to analyze. This question comes from Stack Overflow, and the first thing I noticed was the poorly written title. Raymon suggest that titles should be 50 or less characters, and this example does not meet that criteria (has 64 without spaces). The next thing wrong about this question, is that you can tell that the person asking the question did not do much work to look into the subject himself. Raymond heavily states that before asking a question, the person should do a lot of research on their own.
