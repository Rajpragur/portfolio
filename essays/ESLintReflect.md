# ESLINT
Getting ESLint to work was quite a hassle.  I had issues downloading all the necessary files, couldn't figure out how to install with my terminal, and struggled with configuration.  I had almost given up on it before even working with it.  I'm glad I didnt make that mistake.  After discussing with another classmate, I was able to get up and running and I'm bummed I didn't have this tool before.

ESLint is a revolutionary tool.  My code has never looked so clean.  While there are times it gets irritating and seems like overkill, I have to appreciate it.  It probably would've saved me a lot of points on my code in the past.  Debugging has become so much faster thanks to ESLint.  I am able to locate errors in almost the same way I correct spelling on a word document.  It is easy to use and very efficient.  After installing, I haven't had any errors and hope it remains that way.

# Ew, Standards
As far as coding standards go, for someone coding alone, I think they are a waste of time.  As Iâ€™m learning, I feel like there are much more important things to be understood, before worrying about standards.  I think it should be more of a priority that I understand how to produce functional code, something that actually spits out a desired output, and understand how to use tools and functions to their potential. 

That being said, it becomes apparent why coding standards are necessary; it helps others critique and correct my code should I need the help. Should I need to ask a smart question, an easily readable code is necessary for providing context.  As we move forward in software development, standards will become even more vital as a team needs to be on the same page. Like wearing a covid mask everywhere we go, coding standards are an inconvenience that we all accept in exchange for the greater good of the collective.
