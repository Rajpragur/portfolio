  I am a complete newbie to Javascript and I enjoy it so far.  I have yet to see how powerful it is in terms of bringing web applications to life, but I am excited to do so.  I have been wanting to do more web development so when I found out we will be doing that in this class, it was as if it was meant to be.  So far, Javascript has already taken the lead over Java, C, and C++, in my eyes.  I really like how the objects are defined and how easy you can access their variables.  I also enjoy the functions that make dealing with an array much easier.  I think Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective.  I feel that it is a very versatile language that can accomplish a wide variety of tasks.

  I think that athletic software engineering is a great way to prepare for the job interviews and coding under pressure.  I can compare it to the way I get comfortable doing tricks on my skateboard the more I skate.  Muscle memory takes over after repeating something over and over, it becomes second nature after a while.  I found the practice WODs to be useful, especially to get a taste of how fast we need to work.  I think this type of learning is a little bit stressful, but it is good because it teaches you how to deal with stress properly.  You don’t have to be overly stressed about a situation but you don’t want to walk in unprepared either.  It may take a little time for me to get used to coding with a time limit, but I think this type of learning will work for me and give me a lasting skill that I will take with me onward into the future of my career.
