# Overview

### The Problem

The problem is that students have trouble organizing projects and appointments together. There are many different websites with many different uses, that it could get overwhelming sometimes. 

### The Solution

The solution would be to create a website the has it all in one place. 

# Mockup page ideas

### Landing Page
This page welcomes all visitors to the webpage.

### Sign in/Sign Up
This page allows people to acces the website and all it's features.

### Team Members 
This page allows you to view who is on your team and displays all the contacts.

### Calander
This page allows you to view all appointments and planned meetings.

### Appointment Setup
This page allows you to suggest meeting times and vote on when is most appropriate.

### Leader Appointment Setup
This page allows the initial inviter to either accept or reject meeting time ideas.

### Notes
This page allows all team members to create notes and edit notes from all team members.

# Use case ideas

New user goes to landing page, logs in, is invited into team.

Admin (Team leader) goes to loanding page, logs in, invites others, accepts/rejects ideas.

User goes to landing, logs in, checks calander, checks appointment setup, and adds/edits notes.

# Beyond the basics

After implementing basic ideas, some ideas are to have a feature where users accept the invite or request to be invited to a team. And possibly make it possible to have multiple groups one user could be in.
