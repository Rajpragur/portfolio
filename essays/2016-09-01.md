For ICS314, we will be using Javascript to create interesting projects throughout the semester, and what better way to start us
off than a crash course on Javascript? Overall, it is a very easy language to use but hard to fully utilize, which makes it a great
language for software engineering. It is good to have an easily comprehendible language that is also capable of amazing things.
For example, even though I have use Javascript in the past to make annoyingly tricky webpages, I did not know how to utilize
nested functions such as map(). For clarification, I had accidentally gone past the assigned tutorials for this section of the
course and accidentally learned more than what I was supposed to learn.

The method of learning that we are practicing in this course is what the professor refers to as "athletic software engineering,"
which was inspired by CrossFit. Athletic software engineering is an interesting take on learning as it gives us short, daily
challenges to keep us on the ball. Even though it can be stressful depending on what sort of day I've had, I would say it is
enjoyable and could work for me in the long run.
