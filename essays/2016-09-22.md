After my first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, my perspective on coding hasn’t changed a bit. Mainly due to the fact that I am still trying to get use to IntelliJ and GitHub. I don’t really see much of a difference between how we were coding before and how we are coding now. The only real difference I notice is working with repositories and uploading programs. Using ESLint, and getting the green mark hasn’t been  to much of a hassle, the real effort is actually programming and using the actual IntelliJ program with GitHub.
