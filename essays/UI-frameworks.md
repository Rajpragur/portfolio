  UI frameworks may not be that simple in nature but once you get comfortable with the elements, collections, and modules that are most commonly used, a whole new world of web development opens up to you!  At least that is how I feel about using Semantic UI after the first couple of times.  I really enjoy that they based the format of classes to be called on the natural flow of the English language.  This feature helped me to understand how to use the framework more effectively and efficiently.  The Semantic UI framework gives you a variety of building blocks to use at your discretion to create your own custom layouts and formats.
  
  
  What I am getting in return for my investment of time and frustration of learning Semantic UI is the skill of creating appealing-to-the-eye web pages with a smaller investment in time and coding.  Also, you are keeping up with the quickly changing times and staying up to date with modern technologies that enhance older ones.  The way I see the Semantic UI is a whole collection of resources that make it easier to make nice websites but also code that is also easier to read for others that want to view your source code.  
    
  The use of raw HTML and CSS seem so unappealing now that I have had a delicious taste of Semantic UI.  It almost seems backwards to go back to not using the framework.  Because most of the classes that you use in Semantic UI is already defined, you barely have to switch back and forth between HTML and CSS pages anymore.  This allows the developer to stay more focused on the layout of the whole page easier, rather than concentrating on one little piece at a time.  
  
  One major software engineering benefit of UI frameworks is that because the code is easier to read than raw HTML and CSS, it will be easier to collaborate with others and work in teams.  If you work in teams well, you will be a valuable asset to any software development company, therefore solidifying your position in job security.  If your team mates cannot understand your code, your project will suffer and slow-down in progression.  With the use of Semantic UI, it is much easier to understand what is going on even if you have not learned how to use it, especially because of the way it was designed to flow naturally similar to the language that we speak.
  
  I found Semantic UI a little difficult at times but easy in some aspects as well.  I guess most difficult challenge for me was identifying parts of a webpage physically and then translating that into the combination of Semantic UI classes that would match them.  I am sure over time it will become easier to make these connections.  Overall, I am glad to have gained the knowledge on how to use UI Frameworks and plan on continuing the use of them in my career!
