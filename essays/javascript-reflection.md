## Thoughts on Javascript

With Javascript sharing similar syntax as other programming languages, such as C and Java, I've come to have a basic understanding of how to make it work.  One thing I like about the language is its simplicity making it fairly easy to learn and use.  Another feature I think is interesting is that Javascript flushes the extra time needing to specify data types down the drain.  It's pretty neat that Javascript is "smart" enough to distinguish between data types on its own without having someone to tell it.  

## Javascript for Software Engineering?

Javascript seems to be one of those "must knows" when it comes to Software Engineering.  Javascript is a dominanting web development technology, and is practically everywhere.  Now in terms of Javascript being good or bad for software engineering, overall I believe is it good.  The language does have its respective flaws, but it still doesn't diminish the fact that it's one of the top languages out there.  

## WOD's 

This athletic style of Software Engineering is definitely a new experience.
