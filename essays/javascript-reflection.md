Javascript: a language that I closely associated with Java years ago while first learning to 
program; I soon learned they were quite different and not really closely related at all.

My main experience with Javascript before this semester has been occasional use in basic web development tutorials, projects for associating buttons with actions, generating random numbers, and keeping track of time (The setInterval function doesn’t seem to have the most accurate timekeeping, though).

Up until recently I’ve associated Javascript with the client side of programming. Javascript had some associations with the, “Web development is not real programming,” mindset I have heard associated with languages like html/css and php, but learning about its uses in popular frameworks has further opened up my mind to its potential. Learning about frameworks like server side Node.js has me excited to delve for a deeper understanding of Javascript.

I do not have much experience debugging in Javascript, so that is something I would definitely like to research more intensively in the future.

The Javascript related assignments really helped me review my knowledge of the language. Keeping track of of the elapsed time to complete the WOD’s helped me prepare for the possible stressful situations of the in class WOD. I actually had some experience with FreeCodeCamp before this semester, but I had skipped over most of the Javascript section since I had taken similar tutorials in the past.

I was worried about the complexity of the algorithms we would need to generate on the fly to solve the problems within the WOD. Would I be able to problem solve under that pressure?  However the general ease of solving the WOD’s helped to assure me that I would be able to get through the in class WOD and accustomed me to that pressure. I was able to learn my way around jsfiddle, so once I figured out the interface and general work environment and workflows my times went from just barely finishing before the final moments to finishing fairly quickly..

Overall, learning javascript in ICS 314 has been a positive experience and I look forward to future classes!
