I am studying a bachelor-degree in media- and interaction design, and currently I am in Hawaii on exchange. One of the courses I choose to take is software engineering. This course contains programming skills like javascript, application design (UI), databases, project management and testing. If we take a look at a <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/what-is-interaction-design">description </a> of interaction design, we can see that these two disciplines have a lot in common.

Compared to what software engineering covers, interaction design contains a lot of the same topics but just with different aspects.  
 
<h2>Interaction design in depth</h2>
Software engineering is an interesting field where I can expand my knowledges within programming. By learning more within this discipline, I think it will help me help me becoming a better interaction designer. With knowledge about how to create and implement functionality into web solutions, it will give me a better foundation to improve the user experiences. Today it is a lot of websites and applications that lacks user-friendly solutions, and I hope that I can learn as much as possible, so I can apply this into my future projects, to make the solutions even better. 
 
<h2>Teamwork</h2>
As an interaction designer I have to cooperate with people within different disciplines. To succeed as a team where everyone has different backgrounds and no one knows anything about the others specialty, it is often going to be misunderstandings. By learning something from your colleaguesâ€™ fields, it will help prevent lack of understanding and hopefully contribute to better results. 
 
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
By getting a broader understanding of how technology works on digital solutions, it will become easier to see the bigger picture and figure out what is the problem areas. I hope this will help me and my future colleagues to make user friendly solutions that works well.
