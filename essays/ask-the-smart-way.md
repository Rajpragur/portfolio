## The Trouble of Questions

I've always had trouble asking questions when I needed help. Most of the time, I end up figuring out the solution to my problem on my own, which does waste a lot of time. Despite hearing every single professor say, "Ask questions because there's no such thing as a stupid question," I try to stay away from doing so. I find it difficult when I ask a question because I sometimes get an answer that I can't quite understand myself. However, I realized there must be a beneficial way to ask questions so that the answer I get will be a smart one too.

## Difference Between Smart and Stupid Questions

I often use Stack Overflow to find solutions to problems I face while coding. Stack Overflow, a website where programmers ask questions. I will say that as I try to find solutions, I myself have come across bad questions that receive answers that are unhelpful or a request for more clarification. Therefore, we must distinguish the two different types of questions smart ones and stupid ones to learn how to ask good questions.


The following example, shows what components are needed in order to ask a smart question. For this question, the asker wants to know how to find files that contain a specific text in Linux.

```
Q: How do I find all files containing specific text on Linux?

I'm trying to find a way to scan my entire Linux system for all files containing a specific string of text. Just to clarify, I'm looking for text within the file, not in the file name.

When I was looking up how to do this, I came across this solution twice:
  find / -type f -exec grep -H 'text-to-find-here' {} \;

However, it doesn't work. It seems to display every single file in the system.

Is this close to the proper way to do it? If not, how should I? This ability to find text strings in files would be extraordinarily useful for some programming projects I'm doing.
```
The title of his question showed exactly what he was trying to figure out. In addition to this, the asker began his question by stating his goal. He the went into specifics of what he tried and the result he got. This shows that he has put in effort to find a solution to his problem, but did not have any success in finding a solution that works for him, and therefore decided to ask it himself. Although not as important, the asker did fail to show courtesy with a thank you to whoever may answer his question.
 
There were almost 54 responses to his question, showing that he succeeded in receiving a solution from many users. The answers were filled with various solutions to his problem, and the top answer was very informative in showing the command he could use, and explaining how he could change different parts of it to achieve different results when trying to search for a specific text.

The opposite of smart questions, would of course be unhelpful questions. While there are decent questions that benefit everyone, there are those one can ask to create an entirely different effect. In the following example, the user wants to find a general formula to calculate the minimum and maximum height of a binary tree.

```
Q: Binary Tree Height

I need a general formula to calculate the minimum height of the binary tree and the maximum height of the binary tree. (not the binary search tree)
```
The title of the user's question was relevant to what he was trying to solve. However, when you look at the user's problem you can see that he did not put any effort into explaining exactly what he needed. It is also not right. 

There were responses to his question, by kind people who were willing to answer it. But many of the comments stated that he needed to be more specific with his problem, and there was also a comment explaining how to find the solution, but not giving it because it seemed like a homework problem he needed an answer for. The asker should have shown some effort towards a solution before going straight to StackOverflow to ask the question. He could have also been more detailed with his question, but it seemed like he did not put any effort in himself to understand how to solve the problem. 

## Conclusion

Despite having difficulty asking people for help, I think the practice of asking smart questions is good and beneficial. Smart questions will get smart answers, so I shouldn't be afraid of asking for help when I need it as long as I ask it smartly.
