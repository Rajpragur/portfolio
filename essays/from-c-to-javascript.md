My first experience with coding was with a programming language called C. Throughout the courses I have taken in college, the language mainly used was C. I would like to think that since that time, I have become more proficient with C and felt like it was a good time to learn a new language. Luckily, through my ICS314 course I have the opportunity to learn Javascript. 

I like to think about learning Javascript for the first time as learning a new language. It can be very difficult at the beginning but as you become familiar with using it and its syntax, it becomes second nature. Just like teaching someone something new, you need to be able to communicate properly with the computer so that you can get it to perform the task that you want it to. As I began learning the basics of Javascript, I felt that it was familiar and similar to what I’ve learned in the past. On the other hand, I would also say that a difference is that Javascript has a lot more flexibility as it can handle variables and functions more easily, and the functions can be treated like a variable.

In learning a new language, it is necessary and important to practice using it. Therefore, a good way to do this is by practicing WODs which means “Workout of the Day.” In these practice WODs that I have done that go over the basics of Javascript, I would say that so far they have gone well. I think the only reason why I might find it stressful is because I’m worried about not being able to solve the problem and get my code to work. I definitely know I need more practice in order to master this language, but I believe that this style of learning can be beneficial because it will sharpen my thinking skills as I try to process and think about how I can solve the problem and create a function that can produce the result that I want it to. I am hoping that it can help me in our future in-class WODs and towards the bigger projects and tasks I face in the future.
