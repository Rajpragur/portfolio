## Swipe Right on Coding Standards and ESLint?

### What the heck are coding standards?
From what I have gathered in my first week, I would say that a coding standard for code is equivalent to a specific grammar, format or style in writing essays. While most people know how to craft a sentence and a paragraph, these standards establish a general look and feel depending on whether the essay is a blog post, academic journal, science report or magazine. Similarly, coding standards are a set of guidelines or conventions to set a common look and feel for the code which vary depending on the team, company, project or software. While there are valid arguments and reasonings as to which coding standard may be the best fit, the most important thing is that the team has a coding standard that all members adheres to. 

### Coding Standards are even more important for team sports
This is especially important in the Computer Science world because software engineering is a team sport. Within each project team there are a number of people who collaborate to develop and test the code. For longer projects, there will be software programmers after you who need to pick up where you left off and larger projects can grow into a company with hundreds of software engineers working on the code. Imagine trying trying to write an book with hundreds together with 100 other authors— there’s a reason why we have the saying “there are too many cooks in the kitchen”. So because of the scalability of the code and its teams, I believe setting coding conventions for everyone to follow makes a huge difference in the quality of the code. 

### ESLint = spellcheck
However, I also think coding standards would be almost useless without ESLint. ESLint is like the spellcheck of coding conventions; it shows you errors where your code does not adhere to the established coding conventions. In practicality, software engineers have their own unique coding style and habits which can be difficult to move away from once they join a project with specific coding conventions. However, ESLint through behavior reinforcement with the red ‘x’ as negative reinforcement and the green check mark as positive reinforcement trains software engineers and ensures they adhere to the coding standard.

### ESLint as a learning tool
In my opinion, ESLint can be helpful in fixing the ‘stupid’ errors like missing a curly brace or misspelling a variable. So instead of spending hours of frustration looking for that small mistake, you can find and fix those problems quickly. This gives you time to focus on the more important ares of your code such as developing algorithms or increasing the efficiency of your program. In continuing my spellcheck analogy, the spellcheck helps you fix the misspellings and thereby gives you time to focus on the theme and message of the essay. ESLint corrects you quickly and gives you the hints and links to documentation to learn the right spelling. This makes coding standards and ESLint an incredible learning tool for software developers adopting a new coding style. However, this begs the question, would having ESLint as spellcheck turn you into a lazy programmer?

### Swipe right? Super like?
Coding Standards and ESLint have incredible power and scalability to improve the readability and clarity of your code. I would definitely at least swipe right. It looks like it has the potential to be one of the most important software engineering techniques, but I will have to experiment with it for another few months before declaring it as the single most important tool to increase code quality and clicking the super like.
