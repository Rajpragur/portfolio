We've all heard the saying that "there's no such thing as a dumb question", and yes, in many aspects this saying is true, there are many times where a question is ineffective in helping the asker achieve their end goal of solving their question and sometimes even prolongs the whole process. This is where smart questions come into play, or a question that effectively describes the issue as well as some of the things you've done to solve it. These types of questions make people more willing to answer and help you solve your problem So while we shouldn't dissuade people from asking questions because asking questions is one of the best ways to learn, we should steer them to try and form smart questions to make everyone's lives easier.

# Example of a Smart Question
[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37245679/ecmascript-template-literals-like-some-string-are-not-working) is an example of good question. In this example of a smart question, the user shows the following line of code and the following output:

```
categoryName="name";
categoryElements="element";
console.log(`categoryName: ${this.categoryName}\ncategoryElements: ${categoryElements} `) 
```
```
VM626:1 categoryName: name 
categoryElements: element
```
The user explains that they are trying to use a template literal, but instead of displaying the value stored in the template literal it is displaying the literal code that is used to write a template literal. The question goes on to get answered with the very next post which explains to the OP(original poster) that a template literal requires the use of backticks instead of single or double quotes. 

# Example of an Ineffective Question
[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42384565/return-json-object-with-duplicate-keys-using-c-sharp) is an example of an ineffective question. This post doesn't really even pose a question, rather a statement that they've tried something, but it's not working and giving them the wrong output. In this case the OP was only focused one way of answering the question rather than thinking of other solutions, a commenter even goes on to say: 
> You have a classic "XY" problem. You have asked "How do I do X", but you really need to do Y and you think that X is the only way to get to Y -- but X is either impossible or very hard. By changing your requirements a little, you can get to Y a different way, but you haven't seen that yet since you're stuck on X.

and eventually answers OP's question using a much simpler method.

In the first example the question was answered quickly because the OP provided the necessary information to provide context for their question. In the second example, although the OP posted their code context and got question answered, they were met with some hostility about their approach to the problem because they thought that their method was the only way to solve their problem.
