We've all heard the saying that "there's no such thing as a dumb question", and yes, in many aspects this saying is true, there are many times where a question is ineffective in helping the asker achieve their end goal of solving their question and sometimes even prolongs the whole process. This is where smart questions come into play, or a question that effectively describes the issue as well as some of the things you've done to solve it. These types of questions make people more willing to answer and help you solve your problem So while we shouldn't dissuade people from asking questions because asking questions is one of the best ways to learn, we should steer them to try and form smart questions to make everyone's lives easier.
