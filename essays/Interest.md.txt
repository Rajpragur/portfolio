I first started programming my last year of high school. After writing my first two programs, I was hooked. I found it so amazing that I could write a couple lines of code, that would end up solving a real life problem. 

I realized I loved programming and wanted to pursue a deeper understanding of it. It was only befitting that I enter college with the pursuit of becoming a Computer Engineer. Going through college, I’ve seen the capabilities of software, and it’s made me want to become a great software developer. 

I’ve taken on many classes and projects that has developed my knowledge of programming. In a couple years, I hope to know even more and have the experience to make me a great engineer.
