Hello everyone! My name is Samuel Rivers, and I am second year student at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, currently majoring in Management Information Systems and Marketing. I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, and love to try new hobbies & activities. I'm always eager to try to new food and explore new destinations. 

As a sophomore in college, I am still trying to figure out what career path I want to take in life. I now work part time for Tricked Out Accessories, a phone repair and retail company, where I learned sales skills and became a certified repair technician. Because I have a passion for technology, and greatly enjoy working/interacting with people, I decided to pursue a B.B.A. in MIS and Marketing. 

I took this course not only because it is a major requirement, but also because I have very limited knowledge on coding, which plays a crucial role in MIS. With technology becoming so advanced and the world becoming so dependent on innovation, knowing how to code is a very valuable skill. I enjoy trying new things, and I am excited to be learning the basics of MIS.

Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy during these unprescedented times! I look forward to getting to know all of you better during the course of this semester! :)
