  This week I was able to experience the basics of the programing language JavaScript. This language was mentioned many times throughout my classes at UH, so it was very interesting getting to learn a little about what people have talked about. Even though its only been a week of learning this language, I do not like it already. JavaScript seems to be the wild west of languages compared to what I have learned so far (java, c, c++). The previous languages have a more strict approach compared to JavaScript. Even in class, a student pointed out that the professor was missing a semicolon in his code. The professor said it was okay, ran his code, and the program worked fine. This does not currently make any sense to me, so I guess you can say my disliking of the language currently comes from a place of ignorance. 

  I currently do not know much about Software Engineering or JavaScript, so I also do not know how good JavaScript will be in a Sowtfware Engineering perspective. My guess is that due to JavaScript's flexibility, it will be a great language in this perspective. I am excited to learn more about both topics, and have so far really enjoyed my time in this class.

  The "athletic" approach to teaching this class is very fascinating. I really enjoyed the practice wods so far, since it prepared me to complete the first wod before the dnf time. It is also fun to retry the practice wods to get better times, kind of like a game. I think it's important to practice every day if you want to be good at something, and these small exercises get me to use my brain and think for a little bit. The only downside to this style of learning is the amount of time it can take. I am also enrolled in ICS 311, and the combination of these classes has already made me start to lose my mind by the end of week 2(only a little bit). I know that if I put in the time every week and follow the schedule, that this system will work for me. It will be very hard to balance classes and work with the amount of homework that is given so far, but I will try my best!
