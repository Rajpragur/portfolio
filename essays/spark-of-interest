  My interests in Software Engineering begins with the endless possibilities of what apps can accomplish.  Along with what smartphones are capable of nowadays, app development can be a very powerful force to be reckoned with.  The thing that really amazes me is that I used to dream of the day that I could have a portable gaming console (that is backlit) that I could take with me anywhere so I could play my favorite game on demand.  I used to have a regular Gameboy (the thick grey one with the yellow LCD screen), and now I compare it to the iPhone 6.  Now I can play video games, see where I am in the world (GPS), organize my shopping list, edit videos, keep track of my calories, and the list goes on and on.  What sparked my interest about Software Engineering is when I took a step back and analyzed what exactly it is we are engineering.  We are usually creating software that is making some kind of task easier or simpler, therefore directly impacting individual's lives.  
  The fact that creativity pays off in this field is also what sparked my interest in Software Engineering.  I am the type of person that has a billion and one games to play with a bottle cap, a cup, and a rubberband.  I am looking to gain the technical knowledge and programming experience to put my ideas into motion.  I view developing apps as starting new businesses, only with less sacrifice and more opportunity to gain.
