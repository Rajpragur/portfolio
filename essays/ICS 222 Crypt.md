In ICS 222 : Basic Concepts of Comp. Sci students were required to do two writing assignments, one at the beginning of the course and one at the end. Students had two options, these being :

1. *Essay on the topic : How does studying computer science (and in particular this course) change my views of computers (phones, networks...) and my interactions with them?*

2. *Please choose a research topic from the area of the course, and provide a brief abstract (100-250 words). You can choose topics from history of computation in Computer Book, or propose your own topic. Mariam or Dusko will approve or modify your choice. (The full report will be due on December 3.)*

I went with the second option because I found it to be more interesting. Also I wanted to use the tools given in this class to learn more about cryptography.

Here is my [abstract](Nicolai_Roman_ICS222_Project1Abstract).

Here is my [full report](Nicolai_ICS222_Project2).

I was satisfied with my report and it helped increase my interest in cryptography. Also I want to mention that ICS 222 was actually one of the hardest ICS courses I have ever taken, despite the somewhat misleading name of "Basic Concepts of Comp. Sci". The course was effectively a heavy math course.
