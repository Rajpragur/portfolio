Configuration Management(CM) is one of those concepts that may seem elementary, but once a group starts to work on code together, it becomes evident that there are several things to consider when working with one another. CM is important because it helps groups to work on a project, whether it be a shared code, report, etc., without being in the way of one another. Without the use of CM, there could be several errors throughout the shared work, missing parts that got lost in communication, or misunderstandings that can't be figured out. 

From my own personal experience, I had to do a team project for ICS 111 here at UH Manoa and, although the actual project itself was fairly simple, it was hard to work with my team members since everyone on the team had competely different schedules. During the beginning part of this project, we used google docs to share our code. This worked fairly well at first, although it was fairly irritating to have to keep copying the code into our compiler to see if the code our teammates sent worked or how it worked. However, we started having a hard time as our code began to grow bigger. When we had to insert pictures and sounds into our code, we had to stop using Google docs since we couldn't share the picture file with each other. For the rest of the project, we just used emails to send our codes to one another. By emailing each other the codes, we were able to compile it correctly since we had the pictures. The only down side to this was that we were constantly waiting on the next person who was supposed to do this part or another person who had to do a particular function. However, we were able to successfully finish this project, although if we used CM, we probably could have finished this project much faster and more efficiently.
