Ethics is a term that encompasses the idea that there are many choices in the world, but there are only some that are "right." Now what 
is right? Being right has no definitive answer, it can only be described as doing good for yourself and for others. In software engineering, 
ethics plays a tremendous roll on what is expected from every software engineer. Ethical decisions must be made with regards to every person 
involved so the outcome is right by all sides. In the world and in engineering, outcomes like this may not be possible, so it is an engineer's
duty to try to make the most ethical choice possible, even though it can ruin one's work or reputation.
Ethics is not a choice, 
it is an obligation very person must uphold when regrading themselves as an engineer.
