# Describe the web-application you intend to build (in detail please!)
I plan on building an e-commerce website in which a user can browse in an alcoholic delivery system. The company for the website will be called Plug808. The website will allow a user to browse and purchase a choosing of his or hers choice of alcoholic products. Also, the user will choose a preferred method of: delivery or advanced order. The products offered will be categorized in to 8 pages. Ranging from different types of alcohol and party supplies. The categories included are: beer, gin, sake, whiskey, wine, vodka, and party supplies. In addition, I will include a bio page (“About us”), contact page, home page, location page, invoice, log in, and registration. Furthermore, the website will allow the user to keep track of their current checkout.

# Indicate how you expect the application will make use of the required technical complexity items (e.g. file I/O, sessions, multi-dimensional arrays, etc.)
File I/O:
-	The user will log in/register before completing their purchase
Sessions/Cookies:
-	A re-login will appear for the user if there is inactivity for 20 minutes.
Multi-dimensional arrays:
-	Products page and Registration page
CSS/HTML:
-	Pages will be html, and the CSS will supply aesthetics and direction
Form processing and validation of Conditionals, Entries, and Loops:
-	Product quantities, log in, registration 

# What is your plan to ensure you successfully complete your project before the end of the semester?
In order to successfully complete my project, I will be spending a vast amount of time on this assignment during the last two weeks of the semester. There are a few milestones and deadlines I have made for myself to help insure my completion. These include finishing the website by the start of 12/16, then use the last couple days to finish the screencast, while also debugging and checking for errors. 

# What progress have you made so far and what is left for you to do?
I have currently finished finalizing my idea and going over it with Port. I am going to start building the website tonight and until it is due.
