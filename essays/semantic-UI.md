## Semantic UI as the Web Developer's Pre-Made, Boil and Ready in 10 Minutes Pasta Noodles

As your typical home cook, I make a lot of pasta for dinner. It's quick and convenient for weekday meals and gives me extra time to run errands and do my homework. But what if you did not get the pre-made pasta in a box that you can boil in 10 minutes, but had to make the pasta from scratch? Making pasta from scratch is difficult, time-consuming and can go very wrong for the new home cook. While Barilla changed the game for pre-made Pasta noodles, Semantic UI changed the game for styling responsive web applications. 

Semantic UI is a web user interface framework made up of a collection of CSS classes and Javascript functions that simplifies the process of styling a beautiful website. It gives web programmers like me the ability to easily transform an ugly 1995 looking website to a sleek, appealing and modern website. Given that a good looking website is now an expectation and a company with an aesthetically displeasing website actually detracts from their credibility, it's especially important to learn Semantic UI. 

Semantic UI takes styling functionality that developers will need to make every website such as layouts, menu bars and dropdowns and makes them easy, quick and intuitive. Imagine having to write the same long pages of code for functionality that you would need for every website you implement. This would be as frustrating and redundant as having to make your own pasta noodles every time you made a pasta dish. Additionally, for the average home cook, the convenience of the Barilla 'boil in 10 minutes' pasta and the time it gives you to take a long bath or teach a kid to stop picking their nose is well worth it. 

For both pre-made noodles and Semantic UI, the cook or developer still has incredible range for what they can make their website to be using these ready-made functions. It helps them crank out professional web applications quickly and is incredibly convenient for the mass-production of weekday dinner websites. However, just as high scale Italian restaurants would want make their pasta from scratch, companies like Facebook may have certain design specifications that Semantic UI does not provide a styling class or function for. In these cases, developers may turn to creating complex CSS and Javascript for creating the website. However, the majority of us who are just trying to quickly and easily make well-designed, dynamic websites, Semantic UI is the pre-made, boil and ready in 10 minutes pasta noodles for web developers.
