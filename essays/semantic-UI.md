## Semantic UI as the Web Developer's Pre-Made, Boil and Ready in 10 Minutes Pasta Noodles

As your typical home cook, I make a lot of pasta for dinner. It's quick and convenient for weekday meals and gives me extra time to run errands and do my homework. But what if you did not get the pre-made pasta in a box that you can boil in 10 minutes, but had to make the pasta from scratch? Making pasta from scratch is difficult, time-consuming and can go very wrong for the new home cook. While Barilla changed the game for pre-made Pasta noodles, Semantic UI changed the game for styling responsive web applications. 

Semantic UI is a web user interface framework made up of a collection of CSS classes and Javascript functions that simplifies the process of styling a beautiful website. It gives web programmers like me the ability to easily transform an ugly 1995 looking website to a sleek, appealing and modern website. Given that a good looking website is now an expectation and a company with an aesthetically displeasing website actually detracts from their credibility, it's especially important to learn Semantic UI.
