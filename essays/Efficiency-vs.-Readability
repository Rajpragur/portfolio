## Reflect on Coding Standards EssayMany people think of “coding standards” in a trivial way—i.e. minutae such as how many spaces to indent, or whether you place the close-curly-brace on a new line by itself.  I, on the other hand, think that if you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards. Indeed, I believe some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. Do you agree?  After your first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, what are your impressions? Are you finding that getting the green checkmark is painful, or useful, or both, or something else entirely?  Write an interesting, informative essay on coding standards that addresses some or all of the above questions, or goes in a different direction entirely regarding coding standards. Make sure it provides your personal perspective and useful insights.
  
## Efficient code ≠ Good code
  
  When I think of coding standards, I am reminded of my high school geometry notes. With the shorthand I had developed, geometric proofs that took up to 10 lines of notebook paper would take up no more than 1 line in my notes.  Taking notes in that class became a sort of game, to see how much information I could cram onto one piece of paper.  As I could read my tiny handwriting and decipher the symbols, it worked just fine for me.  However, classmates who wanted to look at my notes weren't so happy.  Even though I may have saved a tree or two in my efforts to conserve paper, others in my class were unable to understand my notes and as a result collaboration and our mutual success suffered.  Nowadays, compressing code into as few lines as possible doesn't really save trees or electricity, and I've run out of excuses to format my writings so compactly.

## We read what we write

  I've read thousands of books throughout my life, and I've been able to achieve such number for a few reasons.  First, I learned to read English in school--spelling, grammar, punctuation...the works.  Second, I learned how to understand words and phrases I didn't understand--at first with a dictionary or contextual clues, and eventually with Google searches.  Third, and most important, was that each of those books was writen in the same language, with the same formatting rules and definitions for each string of characters.  I was able to learn amazing things and experience fantastic stories simply because I was able to read the format in which these books were written.  Simply put: we expect what we read to have certain rules and standards to make it easily readable, so it only makes sense that we would want anything we write to be just as easily read by others.
