## **What are coding standards?**
Coding standards is a set that contains guidlines, rules, and programming styles that a programmer follows when writing code. You can think of it like formatting an essay, where generally you want it to be written in Times New Roman, 12pt font, and double spaced. Coding standards have their own version of this, such as how much space to indent for a new line, or whether or not to place curly braces on the same line or a new line. The coding standards you adhere to depends on who will be reading the code since everyone has their own preferences. For example, if you are a student, most of your professors will have a coding standards of their own to make the code easier for them to read and grade. Another situation is if you get a job where you work in a team, there will most likely be a coding standard set so that when code is shared within the group it is easy for your coworkers to read and follow it. There is no universal coding standard, however, there are a few general guidlines that are universal, such as not using tab to indent, and use spaces instead. Another universal guidline is to name variables that are relevant to what is being stored within them.

## **Using coding standards to learn a new language**
Although there is no universal coding standard set, I believe that as long as the general concept behind each coding style is the same, it is beneficial when learning a new language. The main purpose of coding standards is to organize the code in a way that can be understood by others who may read it. By following coding standards such as naming variables appropriately and indenting to show the structure of the code, when you run into errors it will be easier to locate and solve the problem. By learning coding standards, when you look at code you will see similarities between them and be able to read other people's code more easily. 

## **ESLint and IntelliJ**
IntelliJ is a new experience for me since the only IDE I have worked in before is Eclipse, where I am used to the console being in the IDE rather than creating a website. While I do see the purpose and benefits of setting up ESLint, the setup can get tedious and just outright annoying having to set it up everytime a new project is created. When the code passes the coding standards test, a green checkmark will appear in the top right of the screen indicating that there are no errors. So far it has been easy and quick fixes to get the green checkmark, but when the code starts to get longer I can see it being painful to have to go through hundreds of lines of code just to add a space in a line. However, this could also motivate me to make less mistakes and to check more often than not. So, overall, even though it can get annoying with the setup and fixing the errors, I see it as necessary, especially when working in a group so everyones code looks similar.
