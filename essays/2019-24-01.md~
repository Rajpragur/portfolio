## Programming Languages (C/C++/Java)

  Questions are used all throughout life, all over the world. Have you ever had a problem and had no way to deal with it? Without questions, there would be no answers, and without answers, our lives would be filled with these unsolved problems. "How to ask questions the Smart Way" by Eric Raymond, describes many fantastic key points on how to formulate these questions we have to problems in order to recieve effecient feedback. These "Smart Questions" Eric Raymond describes is not only useful for Software Engineers, but also useful for daily living. We all encounter problems in our lives, which to some people can be very stressful. However, as we challenge ourselves do extra research, reading FAQs, manual, experimented with different solutions, and seraching the web, we may learn more than we need to know about our problem. Perhaps the problem we initially started with, actually is a deeper, more sophisticated than we started with. Also it gives us more confidence and increases our independence that we are able to solve problems on our own. In my experience, i found that those who aren't able to solve problems always need extra assurance what they are doing is right. Someone there to hold their hand and walk them through each step. Afraid to fail. I believe we all need to let go of being afraid to fail. Yes, this could be humiliating at times however, it's these failures that make us stronger, challenges us to do better and opens our eyes to a deeper, stronger connection with the world.
  
  However, there are some questions that we just aren't able to solve, no matter how hard we try. Problems that we think are impossible to solve. It is important to formulate the right kind of question in order to give readers the full extension of your problem. Eric Raymond describes how important it is to give the readers a breif summary on what device, appliance, you are using, state only the symptoms of your problems, and using proper forum etiquette. Allowing the users answering the question to put themselves entirely in your posistion which allows them to through a step-by-step solution without them wasting more time asking additional questions, delaying the problem's shelf life. Here is an example on a smart question on the Stack Overflow website [Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array). This question provides valid questions, the use of two different programs C++ and Javascript (which makes the question general to a wider population of programming languages, evidence that they tried solving the problem by using other programming languages, provides the code and even highlights the data from the problem. The question being asked was able to be solved effeciently by one user providing a analogy of the situation on how the algorithm works and a detailed explanation on a step-by-step solutiont to the problems being asked. Here is an example of a "not smart question" [Full Screen Notification on Top](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54359090/full-screen-notification-on-top). This question has 20 views and no solution. This is a perfect example of a "loser" described by Eric Raymond. There is no device name used other than android, no real symptom of any problem, the question doesn't even make sense, it looks like a to-do note that someone made in class. 
  
  In conclusion, questions are important in everyone's daily lives. It is important to increase our knowledge on the why's and how things are done. Expand on what we already know. Because without these questions, the world wouldn't be able to be advancing at the speed it has.
