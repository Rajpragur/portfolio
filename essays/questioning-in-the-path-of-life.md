# A Gushing River of Knowledge

In today's world, I understand that there is vast and large amount of ways to find out information. Most can be solved by a quick google - or whatever your prefered search engine of choice is - search, and which, according to Eric Raymond's [article,](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way") is something that is referred to a lot when it is obvious that you haven't put the effort. 

# Stepping Stones

Along with a quick and easy google search, we have to understand that forums and question-and-answer sites are a last resort. It's something that I've always understood. Don't ask until you're entirely sure it can't be found. It's essentially what my mom would tell me when I was younger, "look with your eyes and not your mouth." Which pretty much means to put in the effort and not complain. 

Google searches with refinement, official sites of your problem device/program, forums relating to your problem, and previously asked questions. It's obvious, even with being on a question-and-answer site for a brief time, people tend to not like duplicate questions. Having a question about your specific topic would be helpful in avoiding that. 

# Solid Ground 

After looking at a few questions, I discovered that sometimes, it's not that subject of the question that matters, rather it's how it's asked that truly matters. Looking through a bunch of questions in StackOverflow, made me realize that while some don't care how it's asked, most people will take note. Keeping this in mind, I need to take extra precaution in everything, even _titles,_ something that I never really paid much attention to in the first place.
