# A Gushing River of Knowledge

In today's world, I understand that there is vast and large amount of ways to find out information. Most can be solved by a quick google - or whatever your prefered search engine of choice is - search, and which, according to Eric Raymond's [article,](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way") is something that is referred to a lot when it is obvious that you haven't put the effort. 

# Stepping Stones

Along with a quick and easy google search, we have to understand that forums and question-and-answer sites are a last resort. It's something that I've always understood. Don't ask until you're entirely sure it can't be found. It's essentially what my mom would tell me when I was younger, "look with your eyes and not your mouth." Which pretty much means to put in the effort and not complain. 

Google searches with refinement, official sites of your problem device/program, forums relating to your problem, and previously asked questions. It's obvious, even with being on a question-and-answer site for a brief time, people tend to not like duplicate questions. Having a question about your specific topic is needed; we can't be vague.
