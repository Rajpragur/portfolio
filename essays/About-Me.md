About Me
My name is Matthew Fansler and I am currently a junior at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS). I am expected to graduate in the spring of 2021. My personal hobbies consists of cooking, hiking, surfing, and sports. 

Why I chose MIS?
The reason I chose to major in MIS is because I have always had an interest in data analytics and statistics. I have no experience in coding or programing, but hope to acquire the necessary skills in order to complete them at an exceptional level. Furthermore, I decided to major in MIS because working in the IT/IS field has always been my long term goal.
