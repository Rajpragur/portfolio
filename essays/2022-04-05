## My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
The biggest improvement in my programming skills that comes to mind is my perspective and mindset towards programming. When I was first starting ITM 352, I felt extremely overwhelmed by the idea of coding by myself. Learning an entirely new skill can be both challenging and rewarding. Before this class, I had absolutely zero knowledge of how to code, and now I am able to write my own. Now, instead of seeing programming as this huge scary monster I have to battle, I now see it as something I can work through to figure out. That in itself has been extremely rewarding to me. 
## I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
Time management is definitely the biggest skill I need to improve on. With programming, cramming everything in at the last minute does not work. I am the type of person that waits until the last minute to get things done, but with programming I have learned to start early so I can have more time to work things out. There is so much trial and error in this class, and starting way ahead of time alleviates a lot of stress that would come with procrastination. 
## I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:
Yes, at first this was a huge struggle for me, especially because, as I mentioned before, I am a huge procrastinator. However, with lots of trial and error I can slowly figure out the WODs without copying the screencast. 
## The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:
This is absolutely true. The labs have been the biggest help throughout the entire semester. After watching the screencasts, I am always confused on at least one or two things. The labs help me to understand the subjects on a deeper level. 
## I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:
Yes, Assignment 1 was definitely very difficult and time-consuming. However, now that it is done I feel way more confident in my own skills and knowledge. 
## I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
When we are asked to finish a lab on our own and submit it, I wish that in the next class our professor would go over the rest of the lab to answer any questions we might have about the rest of the lab. 
## What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):
The Labs and one on one help are by far the most helpful. Professor Port is extremely helpful and understanding when it comes to one on one help. I am a very hands-on person, so doing the Labs all together in class is the most effective way for me to learn.
