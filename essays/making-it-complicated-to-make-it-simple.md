# It's Complicated

Life is difficult. We all know this. We all go through different struggles in life but it only makes us better in the end. Sandpaper. That's rough, but it makes for such a smoother surface. It goes the same for learning. If everything was easy, there'd be no point in learning new things. The challenge and the struggle of wanting to learn more and discover new ways to make things easier is what makes it worth it.

People love a challenge. People also love make things simpler because they like it easy. Sounds complicated, well, that's because it is.

# A Necessary Evil

Semantic UI, while a struggle at first, is a necessary evil, at least for some people it is. It allows you to have a much easier time in creating websites that are much more appealing and would work on so many diverse devices. There are other options of course, but Semantic UI is one that works well as an add-on rather that a replacement to HTML and CSS, and of course, is the only one that I am aware of.

# First Times

First time working with something like this and it takes quite a bit of time to get used to. A week later and I’m still getting used to it. There’s a lot of different things to discover on Semantic UI, many different items and uses for each of them. Even until now, I’m still discovering more and more ways to use Semantic UI, and this is only from using it straight from the resource, no customizing any of the given code, and yet, there’s still more to learn and more possibilities with it.

Which is the great thing about Semantic UI, the endless possibilities it gives from even just what we’re given, allows us to create so much.

If I work with Semantic UI more, I know I’d be able to do even more with this.
