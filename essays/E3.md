The most recent WOD we had to complete for ITM352 was Invoice1. Essentially we had to create an invoice for sales, its taxes, and subtotal. For more information and further details, check this website (https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html).

My experience with this WOD went pretty decently. Overall the things I did well at were knowing the technical terms to type and reiterating the code for each of the sales. However, in my first attempt, I did stumble with forgetting quotes or mispelling at times, mistakes that are easily avoidable if I am more careful and not as careless.

In preparation for this WOD, I prepared by reviewing my notes and looking back at previous chapter slides. Similarly to previous WODs, I ensured that I was familiar with what the objective of the assignment was so I didn't feel lose or directionless. Differently, I ensured that I designated a time to work on this WOD so I didn't feel rushed or stressed like before. I definitely felt a lot more prepared when completing this WOD compared to previous ones.

In hindsight, things I could do better at would be just being more careful in my work. Having greater awareness of my coding can definitely prevent careless mistakes that waste time to find and fix. For the next WOD, I hope to continue the positive changes I made and hopefully take what I learned from this WOD & improve my coding skills.
