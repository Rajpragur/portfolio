  You ever heard the phrase "Never judge a book by its cover."? This phrase originated in 1944 and is still used in tv shows, commercials, and in our daily lives today. This phrase stood the test of time because it actually has a great meaning. Yes, the stories and information inside the book is what is important. However, if we look deeper into this phrase, to how it was made. The assumption that a cover of a book does influence a reader to actually pick up the book, read the book, or actually look at it. First impresssions are everything in this day and age. We come in contact with so many people and different groups that we might already have a generalization on how someone will act just based on their appearance. The design and first appearnace of anything will have a lasting effect in your mind that draws you in, captures your mind, and is sucks you in. This is where great skills of aethetics and coding in designing websites will do for you. 
  
  The importance of designing an amazing, aethetic, modern, yet simple website is everything. This first impression will lead the user to keep clicking and clicking all over the websites, leaving them drawn to keeping their eyes on the simplicity and beauty of your work. Having already made beautiful projects to display for your employers will have them paying you top dollars for your mind and work. It might not even be functional, just the simple design is enough to capture the user's mind to keep coming back to see your work. 
  
  In conclusion, questions are important in everyone's daily lives. It is important to increase our knowledge on the why's and how things are done. Expand on what we already know. Because without these questions, the world wouldn't be able to be advancing at the speed it has..
