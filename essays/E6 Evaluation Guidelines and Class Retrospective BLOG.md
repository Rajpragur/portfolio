<b>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</b>
<br>I am selling, tshirts, water bottles, glasses, and towels<br>
<b>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?<b>
	<br>Yes, There was a lot of things that I had issues with, setting up the session, the cookie and in all honestly I was having difficulties with everything of this assignment and not much was working in my favor when doing this.<br>
<b>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</b>
<br>This might seem as a bad thing to say but what I am most proud of is that I finished the assignment since when we started the assignment I did not think that this would be something that I was going to be able to do.<br>
<b>Describe what you are least happy with your system</b>
<br>I am least happy with my design of my website I do not think that it looks very good.<br>
<b>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</b>
<br>I thought that it was very different from the other assignments there was a lot more thinking required into this assignment and not that much code, I also believe that in this assignment there was a lot more work that had to be done and learned outside of the labs compared to the other assignments.<br>
<b>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</b>
<br>When I ran into problems I addressed the Professor.<br>
<b>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</b>
<br>Not much worked well doing this assignment, after I got help from professor port it worked a lot better.<br>
<b>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</b>
<br>I’ve said this a lot in this assessment but I thought that this assignment was extremely hard and if I did not have the office hours with professor port I would not have gotten very far in this assignment. The professor was extremely helpful in guiding me on what I should think when I am working on it and also where is should start to focus and not to do to many things at once.<br>
<b>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</b>
<br>I learned a lot about looking up information and what to look for when you have no idea where to start on a project. <br>
<b>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</b>
I would start the assignment earlier and also ask the professor for help right away instead of trying to figure something out that I did not know how to do, I believe that the extra time as well as being on the right path from the start would have put me in a lot better place finishing this assignment.<br>
<b>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</b>
<br>I am not sure at all about this estimate but I would estimate that 40% was spent thinking and looking at how to do the code, 50% on writing the code and 10% on testing.<br>
<b>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage <br>breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</b>
<br>I worked by myself<br>
