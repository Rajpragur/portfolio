	I like to think about learning Javascript for the first time as learning a new language. It can be very difficult at the beginning but as you become familiar with using it and its syntax, it becomes second nature. Just like with humans, you need to be able to communicate properly with the computer so that you can get it to perform the task that you want it to.
	My first experience with a programming language was with a language called C. I would like to think that since then I have become proficient in it, and so I thought that as I was learning the basics of Javascript it was somewhat similar to what I’ve learned in the past. On the other hand, I would also say that Javascript is more flexible and can handle things such as variables and functions more easily. 
	In learning a new language, it is necessary and important to practice using it. Therefore, a good way to do this is by practicing WODs which means “Workout of the Day.” In these practice WODs that I have done that go over the basics of Javascript, I would say that so far they have gone well. I think the only reason why I might find it stressful is because I’m worried about not being able to solve the problem and get my code to work. I definitely know I need more practice in order to master this language, but I believe that this style of learning can be beneficial because it can sharpen my thinking skills as I try to process and think about how I can solve the problem and create a function that can produce the result that I want it to.  I am hoping that it can help me in our future in-class WODs and towards the bigger projects and tasks I face in the future.
