This WOD was designed for us to build a sales receipt using JavaScript expressions and variables. For a more detailed explanation about the WOD, visit this [page](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html). 

Using what we learned from the lab, readings, and screencast made the WOD relatively simple to complete. For me, what worked well was creating the variables and expressions to get the correct values. I understood how to do this and was able to complete it without much trouble. However, I did struggle to create the table and embed the variables in it properly. For this part, I had to watch a little bit of the screencast to figure out how to get started. Doing this allowed me to really understand the code thoroughly. 

To prepare for this lab, my process was the same as my previous WODs. For my first attempt, I didn't pay attention to the timer and took as much time as I needed to figure everything out properly. After doing this, it was easy to get the Rx time on my second attempt. 

For my next WOD, I could be better prepared by knowing the actual content better. During my first attempt for this WOD, I had to spend a lot of time looking up things that I already read about. Next time, I might try to review the readings before doing my WOD so I can avoid wasting time.
