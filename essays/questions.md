<center> "Remember to ask questions! There's no such thing as a stupid question." 

<p> I remember classes with hard topics the most, listening to those professors read off PowerPoint slides was like getting hit in the head with a hammer because I blacked out. On the bright side, I got the greatest naps in those classes. I specifically remember, after every lecture, the professor would make sure to ask if any students had any questions; he had even stated on the first day of class, that asking questions is essential to passing. Amidst my confused classmates, a student sitting close to the front of the classroom raised his hand. "Ah yes, the sacrificial lamb," I thought to myself, "good on you, taking one for the TEAM!" After he asked his question, immediately after the professor processed the question, the look of "really? THAT'S the question you're asking?" slowly emerged on his face. After years of witnessing cases of stupid question syndrome, I've developed a fear of asking a professor a question. Usually, I would deliberate over the problem and solve it myself, but I honestly don't know the answer, then I will resort to asking questions. Currently, my methods to getting questions answered is wait for someone else to ask it, ask a classmate, and type up 50 different drafts of the same question and immediately wallow in despair after sending the email to the professor. Although, I disagree when people say there are no stupid questions, I do know that questions are necessary... the smart ones, that is.

<p> The impact of smart questions are greater than the impact of stupid questions. Life is a battlefield, would you rather be the soldier holding an AK-47 or the fool running around, shooting a bb gun. Not only are questions essential to further your understanding of a topic, but they are helpful to other people in the same position as you. However, the answer to your prayers do not come easy. People have to process your question, which means a well structured question is easier to process. [Here](<img class = "ui large centered image" src = "../images/WOD.jpg">) is an example of a smart question. The title is straightforward, so the reader immediately understands the topic and question. The user explains his current understanding of the problem and what he needs help with. He specifies what type an answer he wants to receive.
