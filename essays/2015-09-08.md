## Can everyone achieve their dream?

From as far as I can remember I always wanted to be an engineer, well that or being a professional football player. Given that I was born with such a small stature, I went with the former. As a kid I would see structures being built and new technologies getting created. It would inspire me to think of crazy designs and ideas that could better our society. However, I was told at a young age that becoming an engineer was a difficult path that not everyone could do even if they wanted to. Some people give up on their dreams after people telling them they can't do it or because of failure, but that's the only way dreams fail to be achieved. Everyone can achieve their dreams with perserverance and faith.

## Software engineering to me

Now I grew up playing a lot of video games with my brothers and friends. Football and video games were the only two ways we knew how to have fun. Each video game was created from an idea that someone had where they knew that someone would enjoy playing their game. It was from those thoughts that I believed I could come up with a good video game idea and make it into a real game. It wasn't until high school that I realized how much work was put into creating software. However, that's what pulled me in closer. Software engineering to me is coming up with creative software ideas, designing it on paper, and then putting in the hours on end to bring your idea to life. That's what interests me, that is what gives me the satisfaction and joy to keep creating.

## What I hope to accomplish

## Conclusion

When we rely on others’ generosity and expertise to provide answers to our questions, it should hold that the question we ask should be one that leads to efficient and effective help that not only benefits us, but also the people we ask and others who might ask the same question in the future. Thus, if you have a question… make it a smart one! Asking questions may not always get you the best answer, but asking them in a way that will make others want to answer them will increase the success of finding a good solution and make it a positive experience on all sides.
