## The Benefit of Asking Smart Questions
A question, smartly asked, can facilitate learning, engage the community, and in some cases, generate new knowledge. On one hand, experts enjoy a good problem. One reason that people tend to respond to smarter questions is that they are genuinely thought provoking and fun to work on. The second, and, arguably, most important reason is that people want to help. That might seem really obvious, but it’s important to note. When people set aside their time to respond to a question, they want to know that it will reach its proper audience. They want to know that if someone looks, they will find it, and maybe, in their time of need, those people will find some use in their answer. That is why smart questions use appropriate tags and meaningful subject headers, so that when people inevitably stumble upon the same question, they can immediately identify your post. Preferably, when they do find it, the answers given should be clear and concise and directly address the problem. For these reasons, it is important for the question to be equally clear and concise, descriptive and explicit. Smart questions connect answers to the people that need them. It opens up channels between people who know, people who don’t know, and everyone in between, from experts to experts in the making.

## Smart Question
Here is an example of a smart question: [smart](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52097430/annotation-processor-appears-to-break-java-generics
). The header is descriptive and the tags make it easy for users to find the post. Immediately, the author describes what they are trying to accomplish. Notice how the they outline the problem in detail, explaining what they expected the program to do and how the result deviated from this expectation. The code they provide is useful for understanding the issue but is not too much that it becomes overwhelming. All code is given with explanation. Notice, also, how the author demonstrates an ongoing effort to solve the problem by posting updates on their progress. In the end, they cap off the post by giving an explicit statement of the question. Fittingly, the responses are also precise and informative, giving a clear answer to the stated question.

## Bad Question

This, on the other hand, is an example of a bad question: [bad](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52212713/pushing-into-an-array-with-oop-js). The post consists of two sections of code followed by an error message. There is no statement of the a goal anywhere in the post, nor is there a question. Furthermore, due to the relatively simple nature of the problem and the lack of commentary around the code, it gives the impression that the author didn’t care enough to search for an answer nor did they try to solve the problem on their own. The answers also seem to reflect this, citing the lack of a goal as a major impediment toward providing a helpful response.

## Conclusion
To ask smart questions requires one to put themselves in place of the respondents and confused forum goers alike. Everybody already knows the feeling of running up against a wall and being unable to find a solution anywhere, but we also know what it feels like to find that perfect post that resolves everything. While that may have come down to the kindness and expertise of a respondent, it was also dependent on how the original poster asked the question in the first place, how they described the problem with precision and detail, how they tagged their post and worded their header. Their effort is what attracted people and incentivized them to give their own carefully crafted two cents on the problem. Without smart questions to act as our beacons, we would be isolated in our endeavor to learn.
