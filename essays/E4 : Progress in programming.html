1. My programming skills have greatly improved. I would say that my programming skills has become a lot better than when I first started this class and began coding. With all the labs that we do and the practice WODS, I feel that I was able to get a lot more better at understanding why things work they way they do.
2. I am enthusiastic about programming. I wouldn't say I am enthusiastic about programming. I would say that I'm interested in it like how I am in many other things but I don't think I would have the energy/motivation to code every single day. If I were enthusiastic about something, I'd have energy and probably make enough time for it throughout any day to get some hours into that specific work/craft. 
3. I can do the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions. This is almost impossible for me because when I try to do the WODS without looking at the screencast for the first time, I would just get confused and stuck on the instructions part. The assignment would ask to do one certain thing and in my mind I'm able to comprehend that and understand what it wants me to do but I think the biggest problem for me when I code without looking at the screecast is that I'm lacking a lot of knowledge and specific functionalities and just certain things codes can do. So when it asks me to build a webpage or something, I would need some kind of reference point or some kind of tool assist to guide me through the what the process looks like and what the end product looks like. The screencast in that regard is super helpful. 
4. The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence. The labs have definitely helped me to learn but I'm not sure if I would say I am able to complete them with confidence. Sometimes in the lab, when we are going over each individual code in the lecture, it makes sense and it's easy to follow along and copy code and see what works and what doesn't work. What the problem is sometimes is that when I'm following to the best of my abilities but the code doesn't work and I get lost, stuck and left behind mostly because I don't want to hold back the entire class because I wasn't able to keep up. So I would just try to fix it myself or wait until class is over and ask the professor or email them after. 
5. I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications). Building small web application seems very complicated and difficult but I don't think I'm ready to do something like that unless I were to have a step by step guide screencast on how to build one. My coding at its current level is not ready for building small web applications. I'm still struggling with creating a functional e-commerce website.  
6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning. This class is great in regards that the professor lectures and explains each line of code and what it does specifically and then applies that new learned knowledge into action by doing the labs. That's great, I really like the way the class is taught but sometimes, we either run out of time or some people gets left behind when going through the examples in the lab and is unable to get the code do what it's supposed to do. I think the only way to improve my learning for this class is if there was a way to make sure everyone is on the same page without holding other students back from learning at their own pace. 
7. There are things that work really well my learning in this class. As I mentioned above, there are a lot of good things that work really well with this class that helps with my learning in coding. I really like the indepth lectures on explanation of each line of code and the practice of the said explanation and I also like the WODS because they give us an extra amount of practice but I don't think I would be able to do the WODS without the help of the screencasts.
