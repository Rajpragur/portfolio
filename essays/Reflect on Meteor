For the past few weeks, I have been struggling to understand how the heck Meteor works. There have been countless problems I’ve had to work over, most of which were due to the fact I had no clue how Meteor ran. After weeks of practice, I can say I have a much finer grasp of how the programming platform works, even though it is still not much.
A lot of the problems I’ve come across were mainly due to the setup of Meteor and the code style we were using. So many hours were spent just to get my app running, which made it very difficult to work on the actual design of the app. When I could finally get to building my app, dozens of errors would pop up, most of which I had struggled to fix. Once I had my environment running, and things were functioning smoothly, the hardest part was actually creating the app. Most of the code I wrote is still a mystery to me. There are so many functions and ideas behind what was running what, that it made coding so difficult to understand. Working with multiple pages that intersect properties caused a lot of confusion, and had me lost at every part. Keeping track and understanding what every file and every page did, how the server and client interacted, was insanely difficult. 
I think with more time and practice, Meteor could be a very useful tool for future applications. I’m glad I’ve got to experience this type of architecture, it was a very rewarding learning experience.
