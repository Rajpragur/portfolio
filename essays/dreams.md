<h2>Introduction</h2>
I've come a long way from using html to embed animated gifs on my Neopets account. These days I embed animated gifs while developing company websites. While progressing through that path, I have learned so much about hardware and software that modern society is overwhelmingly built on.

<h2>Futurism</h2>
Technology is an exciting field! It provides ways for people to automate work that is often tedious and allows them to focus on more engaging and personally gratifying projects. 
The future of automobiles has me especially excited. Developments in autonomous vehicles may pave the way for a future we have less motor vehicle accidents and streamlining of traffic flows. (Rush hour traffic commuting to and from Honolulu, anyone?)

<h2>Effects of Technology</h2>
The socio-economic effects of technology must also be considered because with those advancements comes responsibility for those changes. Job displacement as “bots" take over certain jobs increasingly becomes more relevant. Movements for a universal living wage or a universal government issued stipend for people to live on hold promise of a world where the worth of a human life is no longer so strongly tied tomoneymaking capabilities.
Inequality and disproportionate representation of certain groups must be remedied.

<h2>Open Source</h2>
Technology empowers people. With the advent of the open source movement, power over technology is migrating more and more into the hands of the general population instead of
concentrated in companies. I want to be part of this movement. 

I hope to further my education in the field of computer science to not only make a living but also to help improve people’s lives!
