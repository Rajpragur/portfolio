I've come a long way from using html to embed animated gifs on my Neopets account. These days I embed animated gifs while developing company websites.

Technology is exciting. It provides ways for people to automate work that is often tedious and allows them to focus on more engaging and personally gratifying projects. 
The future of automobiles has me especially excited. Hearing about autonomous vehicles has me hoping that in the future we have less motor vehicle accidents and lifestyles
that depend less on vehicle ownership that has led to excess traffic. (Rush hour traffic commuting to and from Honolulu, anyone?)

The socio-economic effects of technology must also be considered. With advancements comes responsibility for those changes. Job displacement as "robots" take over certain jobs
must be considered. Movements for a universal living wage or a universal government issued stipend for people to live on hold promise.
Inequality and disproportionate representation of certain groups must be remedied.

Technology empowers people. With the advent of the open source movement, power over technology is migrating more and more into the hands of the general population instead of
concentrated in companies. I want to be part of this movement.
