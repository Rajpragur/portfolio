First things first, my initial intentions of joining RadGrad was to get extra credit for ICS 314, straight-up. I thought nothing of it other than it being an extra credit opportunity which led me completing all the other steps for extra credit(except for the survey part where filled it out after the due date) and writing this essay. And you know what? I think that's okay, sometimes in life you need a little bit of incentive to push you to do something that can benefit you in the future.
