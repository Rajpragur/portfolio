As a computer science major, you will have to deal with several different languages, platforms, coding standards and operating systems that will all attempt to work together. With each new relationship you build, you will desperately try hard to find the "best" one for you, the one relationship where everything will work out no matter the circumstances. However, with meteor, whether you decide itʻs the best relationship or not, will always be the best love-hate relationship youʻll ever have.

In short, Meteor is one of the most confusing things when you first start out. If you are unfamiiar with building a web app like I was, you need to learn how to use meteor on top of learning about <i>how</i> a web app is set up. For me personally, things didnʻt click until we were on the second digits assignment. I mean, sure, I was able to use meteor by following the video tutorials, however, I pretty much had to follow the video step-by-step in order to make sure I didnʻt make a mistake. If I made a mistake, I would probably have had loads of trouble trying to figure out what I did wrong. However, when I was working on the digits assignment, things finally began to click in my head why we were writing the code in this way, why we put certain files in this particular folder, etc. It was my breakthrough point to actually loving meteor.
