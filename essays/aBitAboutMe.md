I am new to software engineering and ready to learn.  I am currently looking for an internship to get my feet wet.  I wasn’t around too much technology when I was younger and never really got into computers all that much.  It wasn’t until I had taken a computer science course in community college that I realized how interesting coding is.  It’s like a puzzle, and every skill you learn is a piece that can help you solve it.  One of the most rewarding things is reaching a proper working code after hours of debugging.  So I switched my major and decided to run with it.

A short term goal I have, for the next ten years, is to develop my coding enough to be able to ethically hack and improve security.  Ideally, I would want to work on the AI systems going into these self-driving cars.  Cars have always been cool to me and I can see myself having fun working on them.  I find it crazy that people would trust getting into driverless vehicles for many reasons, cybersecurity being one of them.  I want to be able to brag that I was able to hack into a Tesla.   

Another goal I have is to be able to understand machine learning enough that I can develop an effective trading algorithm.  I find the stock market fascinating, and I think a true test to my coding and stock trading skills would be to put my money where my mouth is and create an algorithm.  I’ve heard stories of it being done before, and hedge funds with massive returns because of algorithms.  It’d be nice to get a piece of the pie.
