When I was in high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I was always envious of people who had set out goals for themselves giving them the drive and desire to achieve them. My chosen major was not a lifelong dream or anything, I just felt like I had to make a choice and computer engineering was something that best fit my interests. I chose Computer Engineering because I was always interested in electronics. It was more than just wanting to have the newest iPhone or technology out there. I was interested in its capabilities, and I would look at all the information and videos they put out about that electronic that I was thinking about getting.

It would be a lie to say that now in my senior year, I have somehow figured it all out and learned how to become that person that knows what I want to be five years from now. Instead, I realized I don't want to be that kind of person. I want to be someone who uses my passion and is able to apply it to my work. I'm still in the process of finding out what I can do and how to achieve that. I want to experience more things whether it be related to technology, or something totally different. 

One of my main interests is digital systems. I would like to learn more about the connection between software and hardware and how they work together. I also want to be skilled in web development as it is something that I have found interest in recently.
