<h2>Are UI Frameworks Are Worth Learning</h2>

Learning a new UI Framework can be very tedious and time consuming. Why take the time to learn a framework when the task can be completed using just HTML and CSS? It is true that most tasks can be accomplished without the assistance of a framework, however why take the extra time to write code someone else already has? By taking advantage of a UI framework, less code needs to be written and time is more efficiently used.

After recently learning some of the basics of Semantic UI, I believe that learning a UI framework is 100% worth the time and effort. Even though it takes time to learn how to properly use a framework, the time you save once youâ€™re comfortable with using it far surpasses the time it takes to learn it.

Say two programmers are applying for a software engineering position at a technology company. For their interviews, both programmers are to create a web application using any technologies they know. Programmer A finishes in 1.5 hours, and programmer B finishes in 45 minutes. Both programmers completed the task, however which programmer will the company hire? Of coarse the company would most likely hire programmer A, because companies value time efficiency. Therefore, when working as a developer at a company, being able to take advantage of different frameworks to quickly build web applications makes you a valuable asset.
