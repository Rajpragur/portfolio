## What is a question?

Questions are the reason we learn. Questions are problems we face that which we seek to find answers for. Without good questions, how can we expect good answers. I believe all questions should be welcomed, but good questions should be sought for.

## What’s a good question?

 A good question is a question that attracts people to answer. How can a question be intriguing to answer? Ask in a way that shows your interest.

```
Q: I am using .NET 4 to create a small client server application for a customer. 
Should I create one giant service that implements many contracts
(IInvoice, IPurchase, ISalesOrder, etc) or should I create many services running one contract each on many ports?
My questions specifically is interested in the pros/cons of either choice.
Also, what is the common way of answering this question?
My true dilemma is that I have no experience making this decision, and I have little enough experience with wcf that I need help understanding the technical implications of such a decision.
```

This is a good question from Stackoverflow. The user asks a question which he/she shows their interest by explaining the question, their effort, and their own understanding of the question. They also make it very clear exactly what type of answer they are looking for. With better questions, more people will respond and give answers to the problem.

 


## Now, what is a bad question?

Basically not a good question. A question is bad when it doesn’t compel the reader to answer. Either a question is unclear or just too basic.

```
Q: I'm trying reproduce the game "Snake" in pygame, using the pygame.blit function, instead of pygame.draw. 
My question is how to make an image follow another image.
I mean, make the snake's body photo follow your head.
In the current state of my program the head moves on its own.

```

This question doesn’t quite grasp the audience's attention. The question has some background, but the overall question asks if anyone knows how to move an image. There is no code and no parameters, making it a little less answerable.

## Conclusion

If you want a good answer, ask a good question. Don’t rely on the audience to pick at the question and make their own assumptions. Making a good question will allow more discussion and most likely, better results.
