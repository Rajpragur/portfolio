<b>Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)</b>
I am selling, tshirts, water bottles, glasses, and towels
<b>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?<b>
	Yes, There was a lot of things that I had issues with, setting up the session, the cookie and in all honestly I was having difficulties with everything of this assignment and not much was working in my favor when doing this.
<b>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</b>
This might seem as a bad thing to say but what I am most proud of is that I finished the assignment since when we started the assignment I did not think that this would be something that I was going to be able to do.
<b>Describe what you are least happy with your system</b>
I am least happy with my design of my website I do not think that it looks very good.
<b>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</b>
I thought that it was very different from the other assignments there was a lot more thinking required into this assignment and not that much code, I also believe that in this assignment there was a lot more work that had to be done and learned outside of the labs compared to the other assignments.
<b>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</b>
When I ran into problems I addressed the Professor.
<b>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</b>
Not much worked well doing this assignment, after I got help from professor port it worked a lot better.
<b>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</b>
I’ve said this a lot in this assessment but I thought that this assignment was extremely hard and if I did not have the office hours with professor port I would not have gotten very far in this assignment. The professor was extremely helpful in guiding me on what I should think when I am working on it and also where is should start to focus and not to do to many things at once.
<b>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</b>
I learned a lot about looking up information and what to look for when you have no idea where to start on a project. 
<b>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</b>
I would start the assignment earlier and also ask the professor for help right away instead of trying to figure something out that I did not know how to do, I believe that the extra time as well as being on the right path from the start would have put me in a lot better place finishing this assignment.
<b>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</b>
I am not sure at all about this estimate but I would estimate that 40% was spent thinking and looking at how to do the code, 50% on writing the code and 10% on testing.
<b>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</b>
I worked by myself
