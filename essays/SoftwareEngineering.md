## **Agile Project Management**
In ICS 314 we learned about a style of agile project management called issue driven project management. For issue driven project management, you break down the project or main objective into separate, smaller issues. For example, to put it short, our final project for ICS 314 was to develop a website that could be helpful to the University of Hawaii at Manoa community. This is a large project that could seem overwhelming if you worked solely off the prompt. However, when using issue driven project management you would break this prompt up into separate issues such as: 1. What would be helpful to the UH community? 2. Make the homepage. 3. What basic function should this website have? And so on. As you can see, issue driven project management takes a daunting project and breaks it down so that smaller tasks can be completed that slowly build up the program. Issue driven project management is a lot like building a house, you start with the blueprint or project, and you build it up from the ground up taking it one step at a time. Issue driven project management is a good skill to have as it can be used in almost any group project situation, not just when building an application. It also shows leadership as you can assign issues to the team members to divide the work up.
