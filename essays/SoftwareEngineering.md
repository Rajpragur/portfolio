## **ICS 314**
If you asked any former students who took ICS 314 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa about what you learn in the
 class, the answer you will get more often than not is "you will learn how to develop a website." This answer is by
  no means wrong, but it is not right either. Yes, you will learn how to build a website, but you could replace
   learning how to build a website with learning how to build a video game and the overall content of the class would
    not change much. Website development is just one the more basic, yet essential skills a software engineer should
     have. The main purpose of ICS 314 is to teach students the
     workflow of a software
     engineer and the
     skills needed to become one.

## **Agile Project Management**
One of the concepts of software engineering we learned in ICS 314 was about a style of agile project management
 called issue driven project management. For issue driven project management, you break down the project or main objective into separate, smaller issues. For example, to put it short, our final project for ICS 314 was to develop a website that could be helpful to the University of Hawaii at Manoa community. This is a large project that could seem overwhelming if you worked solely off the prompt. However, when using issue driven project management you would break this prompt up into separate issues such as: 1. What would be helpful to the UH community? 2. Make the homepage. 3. What basic function should this website have? And so on. As you can see, issue driven project management takes a daunting project and breaks it down so that smaller tasks can be completed that slowly build up the program. Issue driven project management is a lot like building a house, you start with the blueprint or project, and you build it up from the ground up taking it one step at a time. Issue driven project management is a good skill to have as it can be used in almost any group project situation, not just when building an application. It also shows leadership as you can assign issues to the team members to divide the work up.

## **Development Environments**
The way that your development environment is configured can sometimes make all the difference to the efficiency and
 ease at which you work at. Knowing which IDE's work best with certain languages will help when forming your development
  environment. By narrowing down your search, you can take a closer look at a couple of IDE's to decide which one you
   are more comfortable with, rather than skimming over all the IDE's that are out there. Having a linting program
    running when you are developing your program is also a very important component of your development environment
    , as it can flag potential errors before you run the code. Much like the concept above, the concept of
     development environment can be applied not only in software engineering. Configuring your working environment to
      be the most optimal it can be will always improve your workflow. Like the famous saying goes "_A cluttered desk
       is a sign of a cluttered mind._"
