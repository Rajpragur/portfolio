__Progress__
Taking the time to reflect, I do believe that my programming skills have improved. Whether this improvement reaches the extent of greatness, however, is another beast in and of itself. I have undoubtedly sharpened my skills yet the more I learn the more aware I am that I know almost nothing. Each new skill opens doors to countless other corridors that I will eventually enter or be forced to leave by the wayside. Due to this, my enthusiasm about programming has declined from what it once was. I am excited by all of the possibilities but I know that if I do not grind out the learning and understanding of content I will slip down a slope in which recovery becomes extremely hard to achieve. In light of this, it often seems that the stress far outweighs the reward of understanding. 

Thus far however, for the most part, I have done the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions. Once I complete each WOD I went back and watched the screencasts incase there were any alternative ways to carry out the same task. This practice seems to help immensely with learning and growth by further cementing the content in my mind. In contrast, however, the labs have helped me little in this learning process. In class, me and many of my classmates barely scrape through following along each lab. Many are more concerned with getting it done correctly than understanding and it seems to stem from the lack of time we have to absorb and comprehend the material. I am able to complete the labs with confidence only because I am using exactly what Port is creating. Left alone and afraid I would probably question my every step because, when completing the labs, we havent actually learned the material yet, we've just read about it. Connecting words on a page to the operations of a computer is not as simple as it sounds. I know that I am not ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications) but I also know that the uncomfortable feeling welling deep in my psyche is what will push me far enough to learn what I need to. 

Moving into the future I think that the class can be improved by altering the emphasis of teaching. It seems that Port's style is centered around the understanding of the theoretical interactions behind the code (what's happening and why its happening). This is really good, however, there simply isn't enough on the ground, slow, concrete coding (the how). We often get lots of verbal explanations of how to do one thing seven different ways when what we are really looking for is a wholesome understanding of how to do one thing in maybe one or two ways max (and how each line of code (at least in the beginning) works to achieve that). With the constant slew of endless possibilities it becomes impossible or at least extremely difficult to understand something simple. The simple repeatedly gets turned into the complex. Of course I do understand that these gaps are to be supplemented by the readings and outside research. However, these are not just my own words but the reiterations of many classmates around me. We understand that he means very well, however, many students are lost and too intimidated to ask questions. I think this is partly because often times a very specific question gets a broad and complex answer. Of course there are things that work really well in this class. The availability of Port outside of class and his insights and help with the "concrete coding" we're all looking for has been profoundly beneficial for my learning. I think the one on one time is crucial because it is the time that your very specific questions can get very specific answers. He doesn't have to generalize the answer in an attempt to teach the whole class something. One on one their is the opportunity for him to teach you from exactly where you're at. Don't waste this resource, go and see him. P.S. If you're reading this know that we appreciate you Port.
