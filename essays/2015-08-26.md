I want to major in Management Information Systems because I've explored the Computer Science and Information Technology degrees and I realized they weren't for me. Not only is this degree quicker to get, but I have some family members in the mainland that could use MIS students in their company. Coding is definitely not my strong suit but I think I would be able to communicate and resolve issues between techies and the consumers.
