 Programming can be very difficult to learn when you apply yourself right into the coding. First, to get familiar with coding I must study how to structure the code repeatedly. Typing the functions and statements over and over figuring out why it wonâ€™t compile because of minor mistakes. I would mostly be concerned if my work of code will work or not, without the knowledge of coding efficiency. The standards of coding are determined whether you can make the program more efficient.  After the first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, the set up is a bit rough, but the program works great. It has an automated system to help the user input code which saves typing time. The green check mark I view it as a pre-compiler to know if your code is valid or not. Compared to a previous coding program I used where compile was a button to click now the green check mark helps to validate your code automatically.
