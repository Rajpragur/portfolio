__Describe the web-application you intend to build (in detail please!)__

I plan on creating an app for beginner weight lifters that will generate a workout for you based on your goals, experience level and previous workouts. I plan on using cookies and sessions to keep track of the users data. Upon load up you'll be asked to log in or sign up so that you have an account that can keep track of your data. The second page will be where you decide whether your focus is to get stronger or look more aesthetic, input what kind of workout you did the last time you worked out as well as your experience level. Based off of what you choose and your previous workout the web application will recommend a certain workout for the day including the exercises and repetitions. When you log in next time you won't have to choose and it will automatically give you your next workout.

__Indicate how you expect the application will make use of the required technical complexity items (e.g. file I/O, sessions, multi-dimensional arrays, etc.)__

I plan to use file I/O to make the users registration data persistent so they can login, I will store the various workouts in multi-dimensional arrays that are called upon and input into functions depending on goal priority, experience level and last workout. 

__What is your plan to ensure you successfully complete your project before the end of the semester?__

I plan to start as early as possible. I'm also going to go about things a little differently and plan out the general infrastructure on paper first to get a better understanding of how I want the app to work. I took off work for the next two weeks so I would have extra time to dedicate to this as well. 

__What progress have you made so far and what is left for you to do?__

I’ve already created multiple sets of workouts for each goal and level of experience as arrays of objects where each object is the full workout. I’ve also set up the basic template of the pages ill need and have started precommenting where and when data validation and input/output should go. Pouring into the nitty gritty will occur after I finish turning this in.
