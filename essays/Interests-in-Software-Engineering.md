I have always had a small interest in software engineering. Way back in high school, I remember I would be playing my games and think,
"This game would be so much better if they did this instead of that. One day, I will make a game that does just that." However, as my mind matured and I learned more about programming, I found out that it was not as simple and black and white as I thought it would be; and I gained a greater appreciation for the choices that those game developers made all those years ago. Additionally, I had lost interest in programming a game and gained more interest in creating programs that could better serve the world.

That is why through this, I hope to develop the confidence I need to build programs that would make people's lives easier.
My father, his father, and his father before him all believed strongly in education, and I hope to be able to contribute whatever I can towards education too.
With that being said, confidence is only one of the three things I need to develop to accomplish my goals.

The second thing I need is experience, which I know I will definitely get from this class. I could have all the confidence in the world,
but without experience, my skills will remain undeveloped. This one is not as important because I have all the time in the world to gain experience, but it is still important.

The last thing I need, which I think is the most important, is passion for software development. I could have all the skill, all the experience, and all the confidence in the world for
developing software, but if I do not have a passion for it, my work will never be as good as it could be. I was never a man to have a passion for anything other than helping others,
but I know that if I can find a way to connect that passion with computer science, I'll be able to thrive in this field.
