#Learning JavaScript

Prior to this course, the programming languages I had experience with were Java, C, C++, MatLab, HTML, and Visual Basic. However, now that I was given the opportunity to learn JavaScript, I am finding that I am liking JavaScript very much. In this essay, I will be talking about how JavaScript compares to the other programming languages I know, how the athletic software engineering helped me learn this language, and my final thoughts on JavaScript. 

##Comparing JavaScript

As I stated earlier, I learned several different languages and out of all the languages I’ve learned, I feel that JavaScript was one of the easiest languages for me to pick up because it contained some of the same commands as other languages, but in a much more simplified manner. For example, Java requires the variables be declared in terms of its type (e.i. int, string, double, etc.). However, in JavaScript, variables are declared only as “var” and can be used to hold most types of information.

###Example of declaring variables in Java
int a = 6;
String b = “Hello”;

###Example of declaring variables in JavaScript 
var a = 6;
var b = “Hello”;

##Athletic Software Engineering

In this class, I really appreciate the use of the Athletic SE Education. Although we’ve only completed three modules, I feel that I am able to learn the “skill” each module is focusing on. By learning the skill this way, I feel that I am getting a better understanding of the “skill” rather than just listening to a lecture and practicing the skill on my own. 

The practice WOD is very helpful in helping me to master the “skill” in the module. For me, the practice WOD is very helpful in letting me know how well I know the skill or not. For example, the second WOD we did for the module “JavaScrip 1: Basic”, which included solving Euler Problem #2, I surprised myself by finishing the WOD with Rx time on the first attempt. However, I know that I need to practice some more since I did not finish the WOD on Thursday. 

Overall, this style of learning is very
