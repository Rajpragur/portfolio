<b> Asking a Smart Question</b>

In <i>How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</i>, an essay written by Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen, the authors pointed out several different strategies to post a "smart" question on different forums. They explained that by asking a smart questions, may people will be able to receive the kind of help they need from the people that knows best - the hackers. As stated in the essay, hackers are "hostile to people who seem to be unwilling to think or to do their own homework before asking questions" (par. 5 in the Introduction section). Thus, in this paper, I will be taking a look at a smart question and a "not so smart" question and comparing it to the information found in Raymon and Moen's essay.
