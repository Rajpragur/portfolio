<b> Asking a Smart Question</b>

In <i>How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</i>, an essay written by Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen, the authors pointed out several different strategies to post a "smart" question on different forums. They explained that by asking a smart questions, may people will be able to receive the kind of help they need from the people that knows best - the hackers. As stated in the essay, hackers are "hostile to people who seem to be unwilling to think or to do their own homework before asking questions" (par. 5 in the Introduction section). Thus, in this paper, I will be taking a look at a smart question and a "not so smart" question and comparing it to the information found in Raymon and Moen's essay. 

<i> The "Not Smart" Question</i>

Source: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41886539/how-to-convert-php-function-to-javascript-function

In this example, the user asked for help with converting a PHP function into a JavaScript function, however, this question lacked several elements that would make it a "smart" question and as a result, several of the users on this forum were quick to tell the author what was wrong with his question. 

The first mistake this auther did was post this in the wrong forum. As Raymond and Moen said, hackers are unlikely to hlep those who "seem to be unwilling to think or do their own homework before asking questions." In this post, the author only posted the php function code without posting any of their attempts of translating it into javaScript. This resulted in several users asking the user to post his own attempts at the javaScript function on the thread. In fact, one of the users even commented how this  is "not a code translating service" (posted by user Xorifelse). 

The next mistake was that this author left this question open-ended. He only posted the php code and asked the forum for help in translating the code into JavaScript. This is a problem because the author did not state specifically what he needs help with in translating the code. By not being specific towards the problem he is having, it shows that this author is probably asking for help with a problem that he did not try to do by himself and wants someone else to do the work for him. However, because he left this problem open-ended, the author ended up not recieving an answer to his question or even recieving any type of help. 

In regards to the previous point, the next mistake was that the author did not state any symptoms his own code gave him. Had he given the forum what went wrong with his own code, if the author did work on his own code as he later states in the comments, he would have the people helping him be able to focus on that one specific problem and he would have probably gotten his answer with a relatively fast response time. Wih these details, he could have also prevented all the run-around in his comments were users repeatedly asked him to post his own code.
