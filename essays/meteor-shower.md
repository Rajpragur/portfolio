  For the past two weeks, I have been developing web-based, database-backed applications via Meteor (application architecture).  I think that the developers of Meteor should consider the name “Meteor Shower” instead, given the fact that it feels like multiple pieces of information coming at you from random directions when you are first learning it.  I think the most difficult aspect of learning Meteor was the organization of files and grasping the server and client concepts.  It is a lot to take in at once, but is amazing when it all works together.  Also, I had some installation and running issues in Windows, which were more than just a little frustrating.  I really hope that the developers will clean up their future versions of Meteor for the user’s sake because a lot of people had a really hard time just to be able to run the software.  I found it easy to use a collection from the Mongo database back-end, simply because Meteor takes care of everything for you! (Which is amazing) I found it very interesting that Meteor does a lot of stuff behind the scenes to make things easier for the user.  The “spacebars” syntax was also an interesting feature that I thought was efficient and useful.  The way that Meteor runs its automatic updates is also an awesome feature.
  
    Meteor showers can be brilliant, uplifting events when viewed from afar but be aware, they can still cause mass destruction.  I will now give it a go to try and explain how the life cycle of a meteor can be compared to the learning experience in the Meteor architecture.  When the piece of matter is floating around in space aimlessly, this can be compared to a human being who has not yet started or encountered the Meteor learning experience.  That piece of matter enters the Earth’s atmosphere and starts burning up like a piece of literal hell fire, which symbolizes the frustration and anger of that human being who had been exposed to Meteor and its picky installation quirks, steep learning curve, and overall density.  Then the meteor collides with the Earth and explodes, which can be viewed a thing a negative destruction or the positive release of energy.  These two views can describe the paths that humans may take along their journey with meteor as well.  Although it has been a complicated experience, I have chosen to take the latter path of positive release of energy and push through the hardships.
