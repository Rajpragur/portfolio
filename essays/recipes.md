# Getting the Basics

We all love food. No matter what that is, it's always based on or inspired by something. Cookies for example, it's the same basic ingredients, but there's still so many variations and types of cookies, it's endless. Even if it's a chocolate chip cookie, they're not all the same. Some can be chewy, some crunchy, maybe even both. 

The point is that so many things can be done with those basic ingredients, and it doesn't have to be that same exact ingredient, it can be something similar. You can add more, change the proportions a bit, and it's still going to be a cookie, something many people love. It's not a hard rules, they're more of a guideline, or rather, a pattern as you will.  

For every type of cookie and for every type of problem, there's a few basic things you need to go about doing it. But everyone still has their own way, it's not going to come out the same. They might even be going for something similar to it but it's still going to work out because that's what it was made for.

# Stepping It Up

This simplifies things for us so we aren't just blindly going head first into something we might not know about. And even if we were just making a type of cookie, we might not even know that all cookies have that basic ingredient list to go off of.

Even unknowingly, I'm following this design pattern. It's a given guide that people don't even know they're following.
