# The Game of Computing

Although ethics exist all around us, there are several ways in which ethics can be interpreted. Ethics, in a very general sense, is having the ability to determine what is right from wrong. This determination will then lead us in our actions. For example, our parents have taught us that lying is wrong. However, as we enter adulthood,  we are sometimes taught that it's "okay" to tell a white lie. This is where ethics come in. You will have to determine for yourself what the right thing is based on your morals and beliefs.
