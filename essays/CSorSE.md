## **How It All Began**
Ever since I was a child I had the knack for building. Whether it was legos, lincoln logs, or old scraps of wood my grandpa had in the back of his house I was drawn to creating. As I got older, technology started to became a huge part of my life as my father was also enamored with technology. He would get a new phone or tablet, and I would get his old one. High school is where my interest in software/hardware development really started to ramp up as I built my own PC and got hooked on games such as CS:GO. Studying software engineering gives me an opportunity to combine my love for building with my interest in technology.

## **Computer Science vs Software Engineering**
Although I am a computer science major, software engineering seems to also pique my interest because I like to build and create. However, I also like to know what I am working with and how it works, which is why I also study computer science. Software engineering seems to deal more with the relationship between the software and hardware, while computer science focuses on the how the software and hardware work. I see software engineering as actors, and computer science as the director. Software engineering is what most people see and know, while computer science works in the background but is important to make everything work. Both are very important to make a good program or movie.  

## **What I Hope To Learn**
By the end of the semester, I hope to be able to design and create a website that is user friendly, but still informative and easy to understand. In the future, I would like to learn how to design programs such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc. which can be run on a computer, phone, or tablet and stay updated and synced together. I would also like to learn general tips for UI designs such as what is appealing to the eye or what makes people click on certain links. I believe that learning the psychology behind it can help with making the best UI.
