## What is Semantic UI?



### "The most complicated skill is to be simple" -Dejan Stojanovic

Semantic ui is like building a house. You need to set up a foundation and use basic building blocks to create a solid, nice house before designing it (in our case, using CSS). One wrong move in building and your house ends up looking like the dilapidated drug house down the street.

Looking at the individual codes for using semantic ui seems pretty simple, but putting it all together to create a complex website is a bit difficult. However, if I were to master the skill of using semantic ui, then it would be a very useful skill to have. Compared to raw html, I would say that semantic ui saves more time, if you are good at utilizing it. Also, websites constructed using semantic ui are visually more appealing, whereas ones constructed with only html look outdated.
