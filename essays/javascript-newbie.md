## My Experience with JavaScript

  My first language that I learned was Java. Java was really interesting because the professor made the class really fun as we learned object oriented programming. He let his students be creative in making any type of project, as long as it included code that he had taught. At the time, I thought "Wow, I need to keep track of different types of variables and a whole bunch of stuff!" I remember having to alter a lot of code because the program didn't run as I had wanted it too. That naive Java learning child had yet to understand real pain because the shiitake mushrooms hit the fan when I began to learn C. For me, C was very complex to use. There were many things to learn about C programming that was completely different from Java. Looking at my C programs filled with segmentation faults is like a really sunny day, at some point I just squint angrily at everything. 
  Honestly, so far, I think JavaScript is the easiest to code with, compared to Java and C. JavaScript is extremely flexible and has less restrictions, whereas Java and C have many "rules" to follow. In Java and C, I need to specify if a variable is a char, int, float, or etc. whereas in JavaScript, I don't need to specifically identify a variable as a string or an int. Also, one of the concepts that I have had the most trouble with in C programming was pointers.
