## Ethics/Morals

  Can you imagine a world without ethics? Throwing care and guilt right out the windows, acting on pure instinct, tangents on our own personal vendettas on survival and in seek of power to be on top of the food chain. I imagine this to be chaos. Without these ethics/morals, we would be known to stab eachother in the back, people who have made mistakes would never be able to get back on track in life, and everyone would just be pushing eachother down in order to achieve selfish satisfaction. The world is meant to have these ethics and morals in order to live peacefully as one. Following a set of rules, guidelines, so we are able to help one another achieve success, having the experience to reanact to one another and build these connections so we are able to advance our way of life. I believe these ethics and morals are quite similiar to software engineering technique called "Coding Standards".

### ESLint InteliJ
  
  Coding standards are a set of guidelines a programmer must follow in order to keep their code easy to read, not just for themselves, but also for their peers, and others who can look and fix up their code if future bugs are found and the person who made the code is no longer there to work on it. These coding standards are there to help people learn new programming languages. As one can easily follow line by line and not always be looking side to side on whats going on. Imagine having a 100 character line full of code with no spaces. This line would be chaotic to read by many. ESLint with InteliJ provides a clear easy to follow guidelines which make the code much easier to read and to be organized. Like anything else that needs organization, this takes time and can be cumbersome than just getting the task done. However, with anything, organization gets easier as time goes on. Turning these organizational skills into habits which then takes no time at all as we'll be able to code without going back to correct ESLint errors.
