    title: Why I Chose MIS
    date: 2022-01-17

In the latter half of high school, I began to solidify my interest in business. With an older brother pursuing the same thing, it was easy for me to come to this decision. However, since business is such a broad field, I knew I still had a long way to go before truly knowing my path. Since I still had years before needing to decide the specifics, I took my time and explored my interests. Soon after, I got a job at a small local business where I was allowed to help with their social media platforms. Through this, I discovered my interest in marketing, leading me to pursue a degree for it. 

My decision to pursue MIS did not come until much later. In my second semester of freshman year at UH, I took ICS 101, during which the MIS major was first brought to my attention. Previous to this, I didn’t know the major existed or what it entailed. After doing more research into MIS, I realized my interest for it. This field combined my general interests for business and technology, and since I was already looking for a double-major, it fit perfectly into my plans. Furthermore, I recognize the increasing importance of technology in the world as a whole, and I getting an MIS degree with provide me better prospects for my future career. 

As result, I’m now taking ITM 352 as the start of pursuing this degree. Knowing the challenge this class poses, I’m looking forward to the experience. I have little-to-no experience with coding so I’m approaching the course as a significant learning opportunity.
