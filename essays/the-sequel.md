ICS 414 was a nice sequel to ICS 314. After learning all the basic fundamentals of web-development in ICS 314, I was hoping to apply the knowledge to a real world scenario shortly following completion of the class. And that's pretty much what ICS 414 was.

From the beginning it was very clear that we were not going to be getting our hand-held throughout the process of this class; during our first week of class we were informed that we would be working together with an organization called VolunteerAlly to basically re-do their website from the ground up. Thrown in to the fire off the bat, was not what I was expecting on the first day, but it was a challenge that I welcomed and was happy to be a part of.

To take on this project, we were divided up into four different, my group decided that we would be called Aloha Time. Throughout the semester we as Aloha Time were able to learn about the many different challenges and obstacles of the web development and project management cycles. Although juggling it all with school was a struggle in its own, development cycle is a process is something that I genuinely enjoy and I could see myself doing it as a career.

Overall I had a good time in ICS 414 and will be forever thankful for the experience I gained in this course.
