Digits has been the most complicated web application I have ever built. The process of creating this app has been 
a long and very disorienting experience. Many problems have come up while working on digits, some of which took hours to fix.
The first problem I encountered was actually just getting the app to run. Before I could start working on digits, I had to get the 
app running. I realized that meteor had an update which had me wait over three hours to extract all the functions to get the app
working. Waiting was an easy fix, but before knowing about the update, I was very lost.
Another problem I had recieved was outputting all the data and tables that were in my program. I've never worked with so many pages
and files before, so I would be getting lost on where everything needed to go. I had not put all my import statements in and did not 
correctly route all the necessary files. When adding a new file or page, always make sure before anything else, to put in the
correct imports and routing statements. 



I first started programming my last year of high school. After writing my first two programs, I was hooked. I found it so amazing that I could write a couple lines of code, that would end up solving a real life problem. 

I realized I loved programming and wanted to pursue a deeper understanding of it. It was only befitting that I enter college with the pursuit of becoming a Computer Engineer. Going through college, I’ve seen the capabilities of software, and it’s made me want to become a great software developer. 

I’ve taken on many classes and projects that has developed my knowledge of programming. In a couple years, I hope to know even more and have the experience to make me a great engineer.
