# My programming skills have greatly improved.
Overall, I would say my coding skills have greatly improved. When I came in to ITM352, I knew basically nothing, now I have learned so much through the last semester from HTMLs, loops, conditionals, arrays, CSS, File O/I, functions. Hence, a basic understanding of application/website building.

# I am enthusiastic about programming.
I am extremely enthusiastic about programming because of the opportunity IT offers in the present and current job market. In addition, JavaScript coding is a very valuable skill to obtain as most companies have moved in the JavaScript wave.

# I can do the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions.
I can complete around half of the WODS without looking at the solutions. I am comfortable with the browser histories to the first invoice. However, with Invoice 1-2 I still require help from the screencasts and internet. Overall, I do not have everything glued in my head. I will still use the internet on most basis, while also referencing old examples for checks and help. 

# The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
The labs have been extremely helpful in teaching me different functions, methods, and processes for programing in JavaScript. Each lab presents a situation to apply a brand new skill or build on from a previous module. In addition, the labs also act as a constant reference when dealing with the heavy assignments/projects.  

# I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications).
Yes, I feel comfortable completing the rest of the assignments on the semester. The final will be challenging but I am confident I will finish a functioning application. 

# I think the class can be improved to help my learning.
After taking this class, some points of improvement I would advise are: clearer directions on what is due and the deadlines. Lastly, I would add more labs or lessons involving game building or simple simulations because of the excitement factor that they offer.
