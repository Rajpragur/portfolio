title: Why MIS?
date: 2022-01-17
---

My name is Cheung-Ming Cheng-Leever, but I prefer to just go by Ming. I am currently a junior majoring in Finance, and just recently added Management Information Systems as a second major. I have decided to become an MIS major because earning an MIS degree in today's work environment can be a great way to put yourself ahead of others. The ability to code and understand how businesses use information systems to improve company operations is a huge advantage in the workplace. The skills you learn as an MIS major can be applied to many different industries and can be useful in many different positions. I am both excited and nervous to take this course, but nonetheless I am positive I will learn a lot.
