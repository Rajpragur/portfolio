## What is software engineering and does it mean that I can fix your internet?

Unfortunately, not quite. While there is a crossover between Software engineers and people who work at the IT Help Desk or the Apple Genius Bar, these professions are actually completely different and require very different skillsets. So while we may look equally nerdy and there are software engineers who know how to fix your computer, printer or internet, I as graduating Computer Science major and aspiring Software Engineer, am not one of those people. A software engineer is actually someone who understands the needs of a customer and then designs, implement and maintains computer software or program with code. We are responsible for the dating apps on your phone, the online shopping websites you visit and the programs on your laptop. 

## So why should you or I care about Software Engineering? 

In today’s world, anything that uses technology will also need a software engineer to build and maintain it. As as a result, software engineers have the incredible ability to apply their skillset to any industry, company or cause. As someone still in the process of exploring the type of industry I want to work in, a background in software engineering gives me the flexibility to apply my background almost anywhere. Also, because of the incredible computational power of today’s technologies, I have the opportunity significant impact in developing a faster and more accurate solution to any one of our world’s problems we face in today’s world. Because of the reproducibility and ease of expansion, software engineers can then help a lot of people very quickly. 

Software engineering can apply to any industry but what inspires me the most is how it can be used for social good and to help others. I hope to someday find a career where I can combine these two passions. In the meantime, my goal is to continue to develop my skills in software engineering and learn new technologies. I hope to gain more experiences that model the teamwork environment of professional tech world and gain leadership and team work skills. I am particularly interested in tech-adjacent careers such as project management, sales in a tech company or product development. These careers are particularly appealing to me because I will be able to apply my background in computer science as well as my love for interacting,  communicating and problem solving with other people.
