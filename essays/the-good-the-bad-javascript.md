## **THE GOOD**
  Javascript is a great language for beginners as it is a very basic language. It is user friendly as there is not much to learn in terms of intitializing variables and syntax. Variables are defined by let, const, or var rather than int, string, float, etc. Since javascript has this feature, it makes it easy for anyone to define a variable and perform actions upon it without having to worry about if they defined the variable correctly. The fact that variables are not given a datatype at initialization, makes javascript good for programs where the input may not necessarily be a certain datatype. For example, a program could have a question such as "Have you ever owned a dog? If **yes** please enter how many, if **no** please enter no." The response to this question could either be an integer (how many dogs they have owned) or a string "no" (indicating they have never owned a dog).

## **THE BAD**
  Since javascript is such a basic and primitive language, a lot of the good aspects of it can be seen as bad to more advanced computer scientist. Since variables are defined by let, const, or var rather than a specific datatype, javascript will allow you to compare a string to an integer, even if that is not what you intended to do. With shorter lines of code, it is easy to see where you may have initialized a variable as a string rather than as an integer, possibly by adding quotations around the integer. Now imagine having thousands of lines of code and trying to find the one line where you initialized what you intended to an integer into a string. It would be like trying to find a needle in a haystack. In most cases, it is better to have the variable initialized to a certain datatype to avoid confusion on what is stored within it when the code gets too large.

## **SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ATHLETE**
  I found myself flustered and stressed during the first WOD, even though I did the practice WOD and attented the BWOD. WOD's are short for "workout of the day" and are timed problem solving exercises. I believe that the practice WOD and BWOD actually confused me more, as I was expecting the solution to the actual WOD to be similar to them. When I tried solutions that were related to the practice and b WOD's, and they did not work, I was back to square one since I could not be sure if my solution was partially right, or completely wrong. However, in the long run I feel that this style of timed work will help me in the long run. I won't always have all the time in the world, such as when I go in for an interview, by putting myself under this pressure now, I can get used to it and be confident when I am placed in a situation like this again.
  
## **SUMMARY**
  Overall, javascript is a great language to learn as a beginner and to use for simple projects, but that's about it. The fact that javascript allows things such as comparing strings to integers means that the code will run without errors, but not necessarily run the way you wanted it to. Since it does not give a lot errors makes it hard to debug and understand where the code went wrong as the IDE will show no errors and most likely there will be no runtime errors. If you want to be more exact with how and where the data is stored, a language such as c is better to use as you can be very specific with where the data is stored with pointers. However, I still believe that it is a language everyone should learn as it is a simple language that can be useful in situations where you need to create a simple program quickly.
