## INTRODUCTION:
I want to start off by saying that ICS 314 Software Engineering I was one of my favorite ICS courses to date. I say this because all aspects
of the course were useful to me. The course covers a lot of bases: from new languages, Github, Portfolios, to a practical project, it all
was worth my while. The material given in this course is absolutely necessary to a Computer Science student. I am overall thankful for the 
experience of taking this course. The following sections will address three aspects of the course that I thought was particularly useful.

## Open Source Software Development
Open source development was a topic that I am now comfortable with. Prior to this course I had very little experience with Github, now I cannot imagine working 
without it. Github provides an easy way to store code (in the form of repositories) for observation and later use. Github is also an incredible
tool for group work. Github has many features that allow for easy work within a group. I also gained familiarity with cloning, pushing/pulling, 
merging, and project boards. 

A sort of "breakthrough moment" I had with Github was tied to a previous experience I had with the site. A few years ago I directed to Github
to download the code for an online game I had been playing. I went to Github because I was told that it would be possible to customize the game
to my own desires, and eventually be able to play my own version of the game. However I found the instructions to be complicated and beyond
my level of understanding. Therefore, I never had the chance to modify and play the game to my liking. I also had a very elementary understanding
of code (this game had a lot of JavaScript).

After taking ICS 314, I now have the knowledge needed to actually work with open source software projects. I now have the tools (such as Github
Desktop and IDEs) to clone code and make edits easily. I also now know to test my code locally before deploying it to a real server. Concluding,
Github is the best version control system today for code, and for good reason.

## Development Environments

Development Environments go hand-in-hand with Github. I have had experience and success using IDEs such as Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ for
class assignments. I found working with Visual Studio on my Professional Portfolio to be the best option, because it worked seamlessly in transition
from Github Desktop to my actual development environment. On the other hand I prefered working with IntelliJ for web projects because of the instant
web browswer launch feature.
