I was taught that the three most important parts to a program are security, readability, and efficiency. Readability is important when writing code for a company since coworkers can understand your code faster, which saves the company time, and in turn their money. The easiest way to make your code readable is to follow coding standards. Coding standards were put in place so that everyone is on the same page, and can easily understand code.

## Benefits of Coding Standards

Coding standards are the most important thing when making your code readable. Having readable code will save plenty of time of others understanding your code. Finding bugs in your programs is also much easier when having readable code. If you can't understand what the code does, you will have no chance in finding bugs in the program. Also, having coding standards will help with code maintenance. If a coder retires from a company, It will be much easier to maintain their code if everyone follows the same coding standards. I was told by a professor that having pretty code will get you further when applying for jobs, so I would say that is a big benefit.

## Improvements

One thing I wish was different about coding standards, is that they would be more universal. Coding standards are just preferences on how to write your code, which has led to many companies to work with many different standards. I understand that different languages benefit from different coding standards, but if they were more universal for the same languages it would be easier when working on multiple projects with different coding standards.
