Before this week I had no idea that coding standards even existed. Sure, I tried to make my code look nice to my eyes, like not putting all of the code on a single line or making sure my nice and evenly spaced, you know the basics or what I thought were the basics. Using ESLint, while frustrating to use at many many times, as I began to understand why programs like ESLint existed.

## Transitioning to ESLint on IntelliJ 

Transitioning to IntelliJ made me question lots of things, one of which was why we were even being introduced to ESLint and IntelliJ? From my perspective, it felt like we were trying to fix something that really wasn't broken because JSFiddle was seemingly doing all that we needed it do and were now switching it out for something that takes as many steps to setup correctly.

## Acceptance 

Acceptance. Acceptance is what it took to convince myself to stop getting frustrated at our new toy and begin giving it the respect it deserved. After finally figuring out how to correctly configure IntelliJ to run ESLint, I found that it wasn't all that bad. I began to see the uses not only of ESLint and IntelliJ, but also coding standards as a whole. I started to realize that coding standards were needed because they keep written code, well... standard. Having a coding standard means that whoever reads your code will know exactly where everything is supposed to be, it keeps it uniform and not like a picture I saw a couple days ago where the programmer made it so that all of their curly brackets and semi colons were all collected on the right side of the screen.

In the end, while I didn't like at it first, I now recognize that having coding standards is very important for having uniformity in your code and that both ESLint and IntelliJ in unison are important in enforcing a coding standard.
