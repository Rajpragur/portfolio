The last WOD was the SmartPhoneProducts1 with variables WOD, and here we were to use variables to eliminate hard-coding the information for displaying products. The importance of this is to make the code easier to maintain and change. For further details, go to this link: https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html. 

This WOD wasn't too difficult and the goal was pretty straightforward. There was no particular steps where I struggled too hard to complete, but I did have to take some time to truly understand the reason for the WOD, since the page looks exactly the same when you finish as when you started. But, I realized that there is importance in using variables rather than hard-coding in that variables allow us to store, change and access information. 

In order to prepare for this WOD I did not do anything different from the previous WOD. But, next time I would make sure I am completely up-to-date on the class content so that I fully understand everything I am trying to achieve.
