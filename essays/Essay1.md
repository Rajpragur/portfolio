Doing the WODs was a bit of a struggle at first. It definitely takes time and it can be quite tedious, so it is very important to get ahead and not wait til the last minute.

BrowserHistory1 originally took me an hour or so to figure out. Even so, I still had a lot of errors in the coding from missing closed brackets or just mistyping. Because I was pressed for time, it did cause me to make even more mistakes, only furthering the process time. After watching the video, I was able to grasp what I had to do a little easier. After a couple attempts, I was able to get my time down to a little over 20 minutes, a huge imporvement compared to before. I was starting to get familiar with coding and how to properly utilize html.

With BrowserHistory2 and BrowserHistory 3, I had a much less stressful time. For BrowserHistory1 I had made the mistake of somewhat procrastinating and not getting ahead a few days prior. Because I was rushing, it made the process a lot more stressful and difficult to absorb. With BrowserHistory2 & BrowserHistory3, I learned from that mistake and started working earlier. The first attempts on both took about 15-20 minutes respectively. After watching the video and finding out where I had mistakes, I believed I could definitely reach better times. For my second attempt for BrowserHistory 2, I was able to successfully complete it at around 6 minutes, while for my second attempt for BrowserHistory 3, I was able to successfuly complete it at around 11 minutes. Building off what I learned from the first WOD, I was able to better understand html and how to work VS Code.

Overall, I learned that getting ahead makes a huge difference. There were many times I was stuck and had to redo the entire WOD because I didn't know where to go. But after taking the time to do the readings, attempt the WOD, and then review the video, I was able to better understand the concepts and utilization. I definitely have a long way to go, but these being able to complete these WODs is definitely a step in the right direction.
