Maggie Mulhall
Technical Essay
The first WOD was Browser History 1, in which we had to create the history of web browsers’ HTML page. We then had to format it in a very specific way with a table of contents, in-text links, and images. One of the most difficult parts of this for me was honestly setting up the screen recorder and uploading the video. I spent about an hour and a half on this WOD, over half of that time was just uploading the video. I had a lot of trouble saving my recording and getting it accessible through a link. I had to do this WOD 3 times and when I finally got it to a time lower than the DNF, it only made the cut by a few minutes. I found it really helpful however after I would complete the exercise, to take pictures of my code that worked. I could then leave that part of the assignment to the side and focus on whatever part of me tripped up. It also allowed me to work faster on my next attempts because I had my previous work right in front of me that I knew was correct. This part tended to be in regards to the links within the table of contents. 

The second WOD, browser history 2, that involved formatting the previously made index file, also took me three attempts from start to finish. The most difficult part of this assignment for me was linking the index.html file to the style.css file. I continuously missed pieces of code in the index.html file that prevented me from connecting the two together. This WOD took me about an hour and 45 minutes. I continuously had to go back and fix errors that I made which was very time-consuming. My advice on this WOD, and the others for that matter, is to read the instructions and examples very carefully because one little misspelling or typo will halt the whole project. Be very careful and detail-oriented when writing and use the copy/paste tools when you can to avoid unnecessary mistakes. I also had trouble with the live reload extension. I have an HP and the example video from professor Kazman was on a mac. Our screens looked slightly different throughout the process which was a little alarming but I ended up getting the same end result that he did in the end.

The third WOD, which also involved formatting the previously made files, gave me problems similar to WOD 2 in that it took me a while to link the index file to the style file. Once I successfully did that, I didn’t run into any major problems. The main thing I learned in this WOD, technically speaking. was how to link a CSS file to an Html. I learned two main things as a student doing this WOD. One, I learned not to wait till the last minute to complete an assignment because I problem-solve better when I am not pressed for time. Two, I learned to ask for help early. I tried linking the two files together on my own way too many times when I should have tried a few times by myself and when it wasn’t working, ask for help instead of sitting there struggling.
