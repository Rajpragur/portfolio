## Computer Science

The beauty of computer science can be expressed in many ways. Creating algorithms and lines of code that all come together in a single program to store information, advertise products, and entertainment. Sorting and storing loads of information using data structures like arrays that can help store information on organizing book titles, hash tables for storing personal data, and graphs using known algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest in a map. There many different pathways you can split into Computer Science such as a developer designing websites and applications to showcase a company or introduce new gadgets. Cyber security programmers that protect companies and users from others trying to steal their information. Gaming programmers that design entertaining games that help people connect with others on a global level.

## Growth in Computer Science

Games. In my opinion, the number 1 source of entertainment that makes kids and even adults happy all over the world. In a [2018 Survey]( http://www.theesa.com/about-esa/essential-facts-computer-video-game-industry/) by ESA, (Entertainment Software Association) conducted a survey on 4,000 American households in 2018 found that “64% of US households own a device that they use to play games.” The only direction I see this trend going is up. I believe Computer Science is the headed towards the next industrial revolution. The knowledge of technology is increasing at an exponential rate. It is only a matter of time till quantum computing and super computers become a part of everyday life. Let’s not forget the huge popularity growth in the virtual industry.

## My legacy

I embark on my Computer Science journey this spring semester of 2019 in UH Manoa and I plan to become the future. Learn the many different programming languages that have been on the rise. Create programs and projects that will benefit not only us, but the future. My legacy in Computer Science will redefine what Computer Science is, and my ideas will thrive with success. I hope to develop skills that will turn me into a computer genius. A computer genius that will take humanity to the next level.
