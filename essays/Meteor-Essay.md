## Meteor came along saving us all from archiac monstronsities of earlier millennium web designs

Meteor was first released back in 2011, and since then it’s been one of the most powerful platforms for web developers. One of the more powerful ones is where the client, server and the database can share code, almost the same API and code snippets, which really accelerated the development process. This built application can be easily consumed by a wide variety other tools that work with Node and Javascript apps. It is a module-bundler which will take a bunch of Meteor packages and bundle them into a single script, based on a specified configuration. Applications which are not based on Meteor can use the DDP client to fetch data from a Meteor-service.
 - We can gradually migrate outdated front-end applications into Meteor
 - We can use other CLI tools besides Meteor’s like WebPack, Angular and Ionic CLIs and more and not be locked in on a single CLI
 - Use Meteor when and where it excels and where it fits your needs. 

I'm interested in streamlining my ability to get things done by focusing on learning Meteor. 
My main focus is time to production. That web is currently morphing into something better, something more modern that fits current design protocols of accessibility and browser standards. If I can skip the learning curve of Node for a small performance decrease, that's an easy decision for me.  Part of the development process is to pick the right tool for the project. Meteor can do all of the things you want in some way or another (it is just a Node application after all and can therefore use other Node packages) but it's not a good pick for any of them and it might even end up increasing development time because you'll have to figure out how to do things properly in Meteor. Edit to clarify: If there's a thing Meteor normally doesn't support out of the box you'll have to figure out how to coax Meteor into doing it anyway without breaking things.

If you want to build an app while using the Meteor platform for all your stack, or you want to interact with a Meteor server and use any other front-end library or setup, and will get you on the right track.
