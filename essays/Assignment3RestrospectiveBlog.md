1.         What was accomplished in the project as compared to what was planned? <br>

What I had planned to do is what I had essentially accomplished in the project. I was able to fufill the requirements of the assignment and I was able to create a website with three types of products with my own design. If I had more time, I probably would have tried to have a description page that would describe eacho the products and their benefits. Overall, what I was able to accomplish most of what I had wanted to and had planned to. <br>

2.         Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?<br>

One notable shortcoming and problem I had for a while was the registartion page. But after reaching out to classmates and specific research online, I was able to resolve the issue. Additionally features I would have liked to have implement would be more graphic design and images to make the website more visually appealing.<br>

3.         What was your biggest project risk and how was it managed?<br>

As mentioned in the second question, I would say that the biggest project risk faced in this Assignment 3 would be general errors and the fixing of the registration page. Through my own in-depth research and advice from classmates, I was able to identify the source of these issues, many times being typos or punctuation errors, and address them.<br>

4.         What is your assessment of the overall quality of the system?<br>

Overall, I believe the overall quality of the system is sound and well-qualified. It is functional and is organized. The website is easy to navigate and utilize. Although it could be more visually appealing, the website's color scheme and design is well formatted.<br>

5.         What is needed before this system can be placed into operation?<br>

Node and server processing is needed before this system can be placed into operation. If the website were to actually be placed for a real company, the operation would also need to account for inventory and tracking of the products.

6.         Describe what you are most proud of about this project:<br>

I am most proud of the fact that I was able to successfully create a functioning website that was able to complete the requirements of assignment 3. I came into the course not knowing little to nothing about coding, so it is very satisfying to be able to create a website. I definitely hope to build upon what I learned this semester and improve these skills.<br>

7.         Describe what you are least happy with this project:<br>
 
I am probably least happy about all the little mistakes I made when created the website. The mistakes were definitely avoiable if I was more careful and took my time when writing the code. Although it was frustrating at times, it was a great learning experience. <br>
 
8.         Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. "I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization"):<br>

I completed this assignment by myself. I did reference previous assignemnts (WODS/Labs) and gained insight/advice from classmates.<br>
