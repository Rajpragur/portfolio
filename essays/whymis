I am currently trying to double major in Entrepreneurship and MIS. I originally went into business school due to my father's recommendation, but realized that it would indeed be benefitial for me if I really wanted to make a living off my art. As most of my work is done online, I believe taking MIS would definitely be useful for me in the future.
