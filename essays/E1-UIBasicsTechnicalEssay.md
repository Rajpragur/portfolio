The way I started BrowserHistory1 was trying to go through the steps on my own without running a timer because I knew I would get stuck multiple times. Everytime I would get stuck I would try to find help through the internet first, and If I couldn't find it through the internet I would ask my friends. I did not want to watch the screencasts for the answers until I was 100% stuck on something because I knew if I relied on the screencast for something simple I would continue relying on the screencasts for the upcoming WODs. At one point I was unable to finish the BrowserHistory1 but I wanted to see how fast I could do BrowserBrowserHistory1 at the point I was at.
