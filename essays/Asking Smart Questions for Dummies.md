## There may be no such thing as dumb questions, but there are sure are smart ones

  Keeping up with a field of knowledge can be challenging for anyone, particularly in the field of computer science which is still in its relative infancy.  These days any programmer has access to Google, but with nearly infinite data on the internet it can be difficult to find the specific answer to any question one might have.  Eventually, everyone will reach a point where they need to reach out for help.  At that point, posting questions online can be their best bet to solve their problem.  As simple as that might sound, the same question worded differently can make all the difference between finding a solution quickly and spending hours simmering in frustration.  Even though there may be "no dumb questions..." as the saying goes, there are certainly smart questions that can maximize the chance to find someone willing and able to solve that specific problem.  The essay <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to ask questions the smart way</a> is written by an expert in not only his field but also at asking and answering questions.  He shares the joy of answering smart questions which broaden his horizons and helps others in his field.  He also acknowledges the difficulty of trying to answer poorly asked questions, which can be on par with a visit to the dentist with the amount of pain felt trying to extract the pertinent data to answer vaguely described solutions.  In order to help the rest of us find answers (and maybe a little to lessen his frustrations), the author has spelled out a fantastic strategy to get helpful answers ASAP.  Let me share with you some important tips I've learned that will save me (and you) lots of time and frustration in the future.
  
## God isn't the only one helping those who help themselves
  
  The first step to asking a smart question involves searching for answers already written somewhere.  Some examples of this are searching forums, FAQs, source code, manuals, and even the internet itself for answers.  After all, any problem that exists more than likely occurs to more people than just you.  Even if this fails, by sharing what efforts you have already made you let know those who may help that you're willing to put in the effort and aren't just asking for a handout.  This makes it more likely for them to try to help.  Think about it: if a stranger asked you for directions to the mall while playing on his iPhone, how likely would you be to help?
  
## It's easier to solve a half-answered question

  The next step to asking a smart question is to posting all relevant information.  This way any potential helper has all of the pieces of the puzzle, and won't have to waste time asking for more details.  The specifics of the situation such as symptoms, environment, vendor, software version, recent changes,  and screenshots can fully illustrate the full problem.  This is necessary for actually solving the problem, so if you're in a rush don't delay the process by giving insufficient data.
  
## (Re)work is a four letter word
  
  The last step to asking a smart question is sharing what has already been attempted.  Research undertaken, diagnostic steps ventured, or any other efforts made to answer your own question is a significant part of a smart answer.  Just like the step of including relevant information, it displays effort on your part and therefore less on theirs.  Additionally, this way getting answers that involve doing what you've already done can be avoided. This saves the time of those trying to help, and gets you the answer you need quicker.
  
## This guy gets it...

  As an example of a "smart" question, I have referenced <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/122102/what-is-the-most-efficient-way-to-deep-clone-an-object-in-javascript">this query</a> about making a deep clone.  The original poster asked a clear, concise question.  He included the environment (Java), example code, examples of research, and several methods that didn't solve his problem.  As such, he clearly shared all relevant information, showed he put in the effort, and even gave examples of potential solutions that didn't quite answer his question.  Having done much of the work and displaying his thoroughness, he received much help.  In addition, based on the upvotes his smart question and the resultant smart answers helped thousands of others.
  
## ...And this guy doesn't

  As an example of a less-than-smart question, here is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22255159/how-to-convert-str-to-int">a query</a> which could be developed better.
