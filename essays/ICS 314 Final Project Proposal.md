## OVERVIEW:

When thinking up an application that could be used to assist UH Manoa in some way, my partner and I thought of a campus repair-related app. We believe that, currently, UH Manoa has no way of organizing or grouping campus repairs into one single source. We are not sure how campus maintenance currently goes about this, but we believe that a webtool or application could greatly help organize their efforts. We will illustrate how this app could be used in practice:

Say a student or faculty member is strolling through campus between classes. This person sees a damaged or suspicious railing. They use the app to take a photo of the event, and then they write a small caption about the event. Upon upload, the report is also geo-tagged. The app would also have a built-in campus map where dots on the map represent all reports made. If possible, we could implement a feature that does not allow for duplicate reports based on geo-tag similarity. This overall map could be sent to maintenance. Either that, or email notifications could be sent out to maintenance at the time a report is submitted. 

Other than vandalism or damage reports, the app could also have Lost&Found functionality. I also think we could use the filter() function to filter reports into these three categories. 

Lastly, I think we must implement regular users vs administrator roles. An administrator would have the power to remove reports that have been solved or deemed insignificant. I think administrators could be determined by log-in credentials. I think this would be a beneficial project for the campus.
