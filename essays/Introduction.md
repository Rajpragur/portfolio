# Introduction

29 Aug 2021

Hey whoever is is reading this! My name is John and I had the hardest time getting this portfolio to 
work (even when Professor Kazman looked everything over and said I didn't do anything wrong) but when 
I did... it felt great! This is one of the many reasons why I chose to take on MIS as a major. Besides 
it being the very near future of todays' world, the feeling after debugging a problem is unlike anything 
else.
