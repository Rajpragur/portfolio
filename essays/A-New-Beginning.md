# The Prologue

It's been awhile since I've coded something, especially with a language close to Javascript. While I do not have nearly as much time when it comes to coding something as I do others, I have had some experience with java, c, and c++. I had went into college, no prior experience with coding, and went straight into it, learning java in my first ICS class, ICS 111. 

# Learning Anew

This is my first experience I've had with Javascript. I'll admit, I was initially a bit taken back and slightly overwhelmed by the amount of lessons we had to take during the freeCodeCamp. When I started to take the lessons, I immediately recognized the difference between Java and Javascript but also the similarities between them. As I took the lessons, I said to myself

> "This is much easier than Java!"

and with the first Javascript done and over with, I still stand by that statement. We haven't done much coding yet, but so far, I have had quite an easy time adjusting to using Javascript, much easier than I had originally thought I would be. 

Perhaps it was because I had previous experience coding, or perhaps it was because it was similar enough to Java that I didn't have a problem. Whatever the reason it may be, I believe Javascript is a much easier language to learn than other languages.

The WODs we have had for class so far, has been like a review for me. It's nice and easy enough that I believe it was mainly for getting used to the Javascript language and syntax. The class setup, I believe, is very time consuming when it comes to not being in class, and would normally be very inconvenient for me if it were like any other semester, but now, my schedule is much clearer and I can allow myself enough time to work on this class. It's like my other ICS classes, which was a "flipped class," initially, I had not liked those type of classes because of the lack of time I had outside of class, now though, for ICS 314 specifically, I quite like it.
