#The Prologue

It's been awhile since I've coded something, especially with a language close to Javascript. While I do not have nearly as much time when it comes to coding something as I do others, I have had some experience with java, c, and c++. I had went into college, no prior experience with coding, and went straight into it, learning java in my first ICS class, ICS 111. 

#Learning Anew

This is my first experience I've had with Javascript. I'll admit, I was initially a bit taken back and slightly overwhelmed by the amount of lessons we had to take during the freeCodeCamp. When I started to take the lessons, I immediately recognized the difference between Java and Javascript but also the similarities between them. As I took the lessons, I said to myself

> "This is much easier than Java!"

and with the first Javascript done and over with, I still stand by that statement. We haven't done much coding yet, but so far, I have and quite an easy time adjusting to using Javascript, much easier than I had originally thought.
