  Short to say, Assignment 2 was challenging yet satisfying to finish and turn in. I partnered with Joshua Jerome, as we created a Drunk driving store. The store is an e-commerce website made to offer services that prevent a customer from getting behind the wheel while intoxicated. The store offers 5 different services, with a minimum of 5 miles of travel. In the assignment 2 I learned the server to client side at a higher level of comprehension. The differences between assignment 1 and 2 included: a more polished e-commerce page, a user log in, a registration, and the server-side processing of registration data, there was a vast amount of knowledge implemented in assignment 2.
  Overall, I would award myself 45% of the credit, while I Josh is at 55%. The theme of a drunk driving store was his initial idea from Assignment1.  We spent countless hours collaborating code, improving our assignment to meet the requirements, and banging our heads against the walls struggling with errors.  However, we were able to complete it in the end. In addition, we received assistance from both Port and Kazman in office hours and email help. To break down the time spent on this assignment, I would say: we spent 10% figuring out topic and theme, 45% writing the code, and 45% testing and debugging. 
  If I were to redo this project, I would improve the loops to the service page and the .CSSâ€™s, to make the site look more aesthetically pleasing. In addition, I would start at an earlier time as we struggled to procrastinate in the last week to complete. Lastly, the server to client-side processing of registration data was challenging. If I were to get another try, I would go in for more office hours at an earlier period to help resolve the issues that my partner and I faced. In conclusion, Josh and I are proud of our assignment 2 and have learned a lot of java script/application
