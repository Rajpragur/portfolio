1) Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details

The objective of Assignment 2 was to update & upgrade our Assignment 1 e-Commerce website so that it had Login Page & Register New User Page. We also had to utilize sticky code to ensure that inputted variables for the products page was saved through to the invoice when the user was logging in or registering.

2) What did you learn from this assignment?

The most interesting thing I learned from this assignment was how to design a login/registration page. I have always used login and registration pages for websites and online stores throughout my life, so it was very fascinating to see the code behind it. I also learned the importatance of reaching out for help and starting early. I started earlier than I did for Assignment 1, and I definitely did not feel as stressed. There were some parts of the assignment where I would have errors, and I learned it was good to have classmates take a look at it because they have a fresh pair of eyes that can more easily point out mistakes.

3) Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).

The assignment was individual, but I did gain a lot of insight from some classmates and from previous Assignments/Labs/WODs.

4) How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?

I would reach out to some classmates when I needed help finding problems or issues in my code. I had a difficult time with sticky values, so one of my classmates referred me to a YouTube video that was very insightful. For next time, if I really struggle, I hope to make a 1-on-1 appointment with Professor Port.

5)How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?

Assingment #1 was all from scratch essentially. Assignment #2 built upon the work of Assignment #1, so it was very important to have fixed all of the problems made in Assignment #1. I made a large error of using GET instead of POST for Assignment #1, so I had to create a lot of adjustments. Assignment #2 development was a lot more in depth as well with utilization of sticky values and further server-side processing.

6) Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

I would estimate I took about 50% of time on thinking about how to do something, 25% on writing the code, and 25% on testing & debugging.

7) Describe what worked well with this project? What did not work well?

My login & registration worked well in this project because I was able to fix the errors from the previous assignment. I did have a difficult time with transferring the sticky values from the products page onto the customer's invoice.

8) If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you do differently?

If I could go back in time and do things differently, I would have reached out for help sooner. At first, when I had coding errors, I tried to look it up online on how to fix it. And although sometimes I was able to find the answer, there were times I just became more confused. For Assignment 3, I should start even sooner.
