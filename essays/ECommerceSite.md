	Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)

	Krizel Tomines and I created a realistic e-commerce store that sells Boba, Smoothies, Scones, and Ice cream. Each product has three flavors. We allow users to register, log in, add items to their shopping cart, update their shopping cart and check out. When they check out, we email them an invoice for their order. We encrypt the user's password and automatically log the user out after 30 minutes for security purposes.

	


	Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?

	No.

	


	Describe what you are most proud of about your system:

	I am most proud that the system can save information on users (names, email, username, password, and order information) and keep it saved in their sessions so we can personalize the page to the current user.

	


	Describe what you are least happy with your system:

	I would love to code the site to add a user's profile picture.

	


	How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?

	This assignment took much more time than assignment two because of sessions and cookies as well as the navigation bar.

	


	When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?

	We tried to fix them, took a break, tried to fix them again, and then sought help.

	


	Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?

	Krizel and I had really good time management skills on this project. We gave ourselves multiple days for tweaking and debugging after we finished coding. This reduced stress and allowed us to really go through the project with a fine-tooth comb.

	


	Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?

	We had a lot of trouble with personalization at first.

	


	What did you learn from doing this assignment?

	I learned a lot about saving information using sessions and cookies. I also learned to keep track of variable names very carefully to make sure I am referring to the object that I intend to.

	


	If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?

	I would keep track of variable names more precisely.

	


	Estimate the % of the time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging

	12.5% thinking about how to do something

	12.5% writing the code

	75% testing and debugging

	


	Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)

	50% Maggie

	50%Krizel

	


	I worked on cookies and sessions while Krizel worked a lot on the CSS. We both worked on the HTML files together and the server as well as fixing problems with our assignment 2.
