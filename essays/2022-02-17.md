The most recent WOD I completed was Invoice1, and in this WOD I wrote a sales receipt for a set of product data. This WOD took me longer than most other WODs because there was more code to write than the others. Something I did that I would advise others to do as well is prepare your product data before starting the WOD so that it is easily accessible and you arenâ€™t searching for it in the middle of the WOD and wasting time. Something I could have done better is make sure I am putting semicolons where they should be because I keep forgetting them.
