    title: Browser History WODs

For BrowserHistory1, I was tentative on how to start. I had no idea how to use my screen-recording application and how to be comfortable with it. I figured the only way I would learn is to just do it. After looking over the procedures, I realized I had no idea how to do it so my first attempt was way over the DNF time. I searched things up a lot and ran through it fully to make sure I understood it. After completing it the first time, I went through it again and I didn't have to search anything up, although it still me over the DNF time. Finally, on my third try, I was comfortable with the applications and I got the average time. 

When it came to BrowserHistory2, I followed the same procedure in terms of just recording myself trying to figure it out. I was way over the DNF time again. This WOD was a lot shorter though so for my second attempt, I ran through it very smoothly and got the Rx time. I was much more comfortable with screen recording and my timer this time, so I think that also helped a lot. 

For BrowserHistory3, it was the same process that I had for BrowserHistory2. However, this WOD was the one I struggled with the most in terms of trying to figure it out. I had to watch the screencast at one point to figure out how to continue, but other than that, it was smooth. Overall, I know now that I'll likely have a very lengthy first attempt for all WOD's and this process works for me.
