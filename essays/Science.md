## Insanity

  "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result." A famous quote widely used and stood its ground for years that many people claim originated from Albert Einstein. I often need to remind myself of this quote whenever i'm trying to solve a problem and especially when i'm writing code for an assignment. It's easy to get stuck in a loop and caught up in a specific pathway to your solution even though it's probably best to take a step back and re-analyze what you're trying to do. A couple days ago, i got stuck on a programming assignment i had to do for class. For hours and hours i tried to implement code into my assignment and i ended up digging myself into a deeper hole, focusing on the wrong details of my work, complicating the assignment with additional problems to solve. Finally, i took a step back, went to sleep and sure enough that morning i reverted back to my original problem and solved it with 1 simple step. That's the problem when trying to code. When there's so many different ways to solve your problem. Some may be filled with more problems or there may be one simple solution. However, that is also the beauty of coding. There are SO MANY POSSIBILITIES of designing an application
  

### Bill's Story

  I read an article [The code I'm Still Ashamed Of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e). The basic breakdown of the story is Bill here promoted a product through a quiz that he made that only recommended the company's product if they weren't allergic or already taking it. Without even researching about the product, he published the quiz and it turned out that made people who took the product experienced side effects such as depression and thoughts of suicide. Now, i know Bill here was just doing his job BUT, he violated 1.1 of the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) which states, "Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing." Let me ask this, how is contributing to society wasting people's times to take a quiz that only recommends one product? Secondly, how could someone recommend a product he doesn't know anything about? (ACM Code of Ethics 1.2 "Avoid Harm" & 2.5 "Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks."). I for one am a bodybuilder, so i know how much people stretch the truth when famous bodybuilders are promoting products. Now Bill mentions while he was making the quiz, he did it for money. And money can make us do crazy things... 
  
  Nevertheless, it would seem Bill did not follow the principles of good work ethic. If he only did more research on the product, he was advertising/recommending, he would see that he shouldn't have constructed the quiz in that way. In his defense, Bill also mentions he started coding when he was 6 years old and that kind of repetitiveness of creating little apps and websites for other companies can lead to bad habits. If we all just go the extra mile and consider the implications of our applications we design, we can make the internet a more reliable source of information.
