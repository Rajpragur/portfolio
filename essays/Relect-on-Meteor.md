## New to Meteor
Absolutely I am the one who feel these three weeks like “a small body of matter from outer space that enters the earth’s 
atmosphere, becoming incandescent becoming friction and appearing as a streak of light. Meteor is a very awesome tool 
to build web and mobile app using JavaScript. In my ICS 314 class, we are required to learn this new tool. My first impression
of Meteor is that I cannot handle this material and I don’t even know how it works. In the first two weeks, I feel like I am 
a robot and noob. because when I am doing the practice WODs(work of the day), I had to watch the solution video from my
professor and just did what he did, and I don’t even know how it works. However, last week of learning meteor, I finally 
feel comfortable and successful. I was very enjoyed the process of learning meteor, because from novice to skilled I learned
things and build a fancy website using meteor.

## Meteor follow up
For my final project in my ICS 314 class, I had to build a web app with two teammates using meteor. I think this is a 
challenge for me, because my meteor skill still in a developing process and this is not like WODs, there is no solution for 
this. However, it will be a good experience to determine the level of my meteor skill, because after three weeks of learning 
meteor with some hints and solution from professor, and now we have nothing except teammates. 

## Continue or not?
Meteor is the modern, internet-based, client-server application architecture. I am not good enough to say whether Meteor’s
architecture is good or not, because Meteor is like a whole giant pizza and we only tasted a small piece of this. For me, I
am still not sure what tool I should focus on because I don’t like web design. However, it is always good to learn new things.
