## **The Lie**
"Don't be afraid to ask questions, there are no stupid questions" is the biggest lie told inside classrooms to this day. To put it plain and simple, stupid questions do exists and you have probably asked one before in your lifetime. Sometimes, it is better not to ask as if you ask a stupid question, you will probably get a stupid, sarcastic reply and leave you more confused then before. Don't worry though, after reading this essay you will never ask a stupid question again in life, and all your questions will be answered. The biggest issue that makes a question stupid is that it has probably been answered before.  Nowadays, we have the use of the internet at your finger tips which holds thousands of resources to help you find the answer to your problem. Sorry to be blunt, but you are not special even if your mom says you are. With 4.39 billion people using the internet, the chances that your question has been asked by someone else and answered is very high. 

## **How To Ask A Smart Question**
Since the biggest issue that makes your question stupid is that it probably already been asked and answered, try to make your question as specific to you as possible. General questions such as "How do I loop through an array?" Will be blown off and ignored, as it is a basic question, answered by thousands of people and does not invoke thought to the person reading the question. Here is an example from StackOverflow of a smart question:

    How would you explain JavaScript closures to someone with a knowledge of the concepts they consist of (for example       functions, variables and the like), but does not understand closures themselves?

    I have seen the Scheme example given on Wikipedia, but unfortunately it did not help.
    
This question is considered smart because it shows that the person asking the question has tried to research the question on their own, by looking at the example and explanation given on Wikipedia. They also provide background information on the subject stating that they understand concepts such functions, variables, etc, but is still confused about closures in Javascript. This provides a base for the people answering to build upon, as they know what level of knowledge the reader is starting at. The replies are concise, and to the point, with some even giving links to other resources that the person who asked the question can go to, to learn more about closures. 

## **Is Your Question Stupid?**
What makes your question stupid? Well, as stated before, what most likely makes your question stupid is that it has been asked before. You need to put in effort to try and find the answer yourself first, rather than your first action be posting your question to a forum. By doing this you may find your answer, but if not, chances are you have learned a little more about your problem, and will make it easier to explain when you do ask your question. Here is an example of a stupid question that was asked on StackOverflow:

    I'm creating a compass app, but I'd like it to indicate a specific location.
    How do I insert latitude and longitude in the string below?
    arrow.style.transform = rotate(${data.coords.heading}deg);
    
This is considered stupid because it does not give good context to the question.
