When I watch TV with my brother, he always switches through channels one by one, and by that I mean he presses the up or down button on the remote multiple times to get to the channel he wants to watch. Why would you waste your time like this?! It only takes a a teeny tiny part of your memory to remember the channel number, so you don't need to surf through every channel every time you watch TV! This is how I imagine design patterns are like in programming. Reusing code for recurring problems so you dont have to rewrite a new solution to the problem.

One example of design patterns is when children classes inherit from parent classes. Lets say you are a teacher, would you teach each student individually or teach them all at once? Likewise, if you want multiple classes to share the same functions, make them inherit from a parent class!<a href="https://munchiezone.github.io/">In this project,</a> this type of design pattern was used by creating multiple collections that inherit from a parent, BaseCollection. This is especially useful so that functions that are used by all the children collection doesn't have to be rewritten, which saves time when you have multiple collections that share similar functions.
