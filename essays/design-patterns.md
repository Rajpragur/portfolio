<h3>There's So Many!</h3>
When it comes to design patterns, they've always felt confusing but so famaliar at the same time. They were the foundations of my coding and the coding of my peers, but reading through all of them feels so foreign. Granted I haven't even come close to using every single design pattern, or even seeing them implemented. As a refresher, what even is a design pattern? Design patterns are basically strategies for solving programming problems. They provide an entire structure and methodology for creating solutions. Some common examples include "Abstract Factory", "Builder", and "Composite" patterns. These are essentially systems of classes, class instantiations, and tree structures respectively. There are also some obscure patterns such as "Object Pool", and "Proxies". These strategies permeate through every program out there, showing itself in all sorts of software. These were just some examples, but don't even scratch the surface of how many diferent kinds there are, especially when we consider that each one has subcategories to focus on different applications. Design patterns are immensely important to know, not only to help the individual programmer solve problems, but more so, to help a team of programmers communicate by providing a language of problem solving strategies. It allows programmers to be on the same page and to tackle problems more efficiently.

<h3>Using Semantic UI</h3>
This idea however quickly changed once we started using Semantic UI in my current Computer Science course at UH Manoa. It’s a framework for web design, and although there’s tons to learn, even with a basic working knowledge, I was able to replicate entire landing pages within 15 minutes. That’s powerful. And it really opened my mind to the idea of frameworks, and possibly even creating one myself for future projects. I realized that downloading and working with libraries is no different than what I do when I program. For example, I’m currently working on a demonstration of collisions with circles on a screen. I wanted to get a feel for programming physics before building a more complicated model/game. As I began programming however, I realized I’d be needing to use a lot of vectors for calculating direction and speed, but also needed vector operations like the dot product and finding the unit vector or magnitude. That’s when I decided to create a Vector class to handle all of these procedures in a neat and manageable way. This is exactly what a framework is, only scaled up tremendously. It’s just a way to help programmers speed up processes and make things organized while delivering the same and reliable performance and experience. At that point, deciding to stick to vanilla programming for the sake of principles only ends in wasted time and headache.

<h3>The Reality Of It</h3>
At first, programming with frameworks seemed like a cop-out. It was only for weak programmers that couldn’t think of a solution themselves, so they had to find someone else’s code to do it for them. And although this might be true, in some sense, I’ve realized that frameworks simplify processes so much, that it’s borderline stupid not to use them. Why, when given a much more efficient and powerful way to carry out projects, would you take the harder way. Principles? Respect? I care very much about these things, but in the real world, what people care about is results. And frameworks help me do that.
