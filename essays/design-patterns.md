I am not going to lie, trying to figure out how to write this essay was quite difficult, but then I realized something... Design patterns and the process of using them are very much like the the metas, or the most effective strategies in video games. 

## Using Video Game Metas to Describe Design Patterns

I know it sounds crazy, how could one possibly relate strategies in a video game to design patterns? In reality, it's not that difficult to do so; design patterns in their most basic form are general solutions to problems that commonly occur. Now if we take a look at a game like Overwatch, a 6v6 MOBA/FPS hybrid developed by Blizzard Entertainment, at its highest level there has been many different optimal strategies throughout the years as the game has changed, but for the most part they have all followed mold of either favoring high sustain (in regards to healing your team) or high burst (in regards to trying to end a team fight as fast as possible). Time and time again we have seen new changes or characters be added to the game, but in the end the meta always favors high sustain or high burst damage compositions. This in itself is a design pattern because while we may not know what specifically is the best, we do know based on history of the game, that the solution to the problem will favor one of these two styles.

## The Meta of Programming

Like Overwatch metas, there are many different design patterns in programming that you will generally look to help build your program and solve your problem. While they may not be exact solutions, in they will guide you towards the solution.
