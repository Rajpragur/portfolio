## METEOR, What is it?

Meteor is a javascript web framework. It's widely used because of how efficient and useful the framework is. There are meteor packages available that aid in developing websites. Meteor is like the mother bird that regurgitates food for her chicks. Many things are prepared for you, making coding simpler.

## Meteor on the Mind

So far, meteor is a framework that is very different from all the frameworks that I've used thus far. One of the things I like about meteor is the immediate update in the web page after altering and inputting code into the editor. This characteristic of meteor saves me a lot of time, without it, I could've been spending most of my time on testing my code. One thing that bothers me is the runtime of meteor commands; for example, running the code "meteor run" in the command terminal often takes a bit of time, especially when its being run for the first time, in a project. Often times, I just sit there, blankly staring at the terminal, twiddling my thumbs, and waiting for the command to finish running. 

Learning meteor is a bit difficult. I would say, unless you're a skilled developer, that learning code on meteor is tricky. When trying to alter aspects of the websites, I usually had to watch the professor complete the task first because I didn't have an understanding of where to start. In meteor, you need to be able to connect files together and know what parts to alter, to obtain the final result. However, If I can master this framework, then coding will be much simpler, since the framework is designed to make things easier for developers.
