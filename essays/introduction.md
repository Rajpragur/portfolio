Hi everyone, my name is Stacy. I'm a third year undergradute with a major in MIS and a minor in Religion. Before I switched over to MIS, I was heavily into finance. I got an internship at a gloabally-known finance firm, joined a finance academy and was a board member for the Financial Management Association. As I got into it, it became more unattractive to me. When I sought for a new internship, business technology jobs were the only ones that I took of interest. I figured there was no reason I should continue my degree in finance if I couldn't even find an appealing job. Plus, watching someone code is so crazy. It's like building to child, digitally of course. So crazy to me. So here I am, excited and determinded to learn. :)
